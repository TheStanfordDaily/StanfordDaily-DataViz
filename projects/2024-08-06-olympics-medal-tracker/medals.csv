The options for the fall were field hockey, volleyball, and cross country. She played club soccer at the time, so her mom told her field hockey was the most like soccer and that she would enjoy it. She decided to try it out, and started out as a field player. The team had too many girls on the roster and no one was interested in goalkeeping, so her coach proposed that anyone who played goalkeeper would be rostered for every game and play in the field without a sub for the one half and goalkeeper for the other. She realized she would get a lot more playing time this way, so she took this deal. Eventually, she transitioned into being a full-time goalkeeper by the end of eighth grade.<h5>Career Highlights</h5><ul><li>Pan American Games, Santiago, 2023 (Team - Women)</li><li>Pan American Games, Lima, 2019 (Team - Women)</li><li>Junior World Cup, Santiago, 2016 (Team - Women)</li></ul><h5> World Championship Experience</h5><ul><li>Silver - 2016 Women's Junior Pan American Games (Trinidad & Tobago)</li><li>Bronze - 2019 Pan American Games (Lima, Peru)</li><li>4th - 2022 Pan American Cup (Santiago, Chile)</li><li>8th - 2016 Women’s Hockey Junior World Cup (Santiago, Chile)</li><li>9th - 2021-22 FIH Pro League (worldwide)</li><li>9th - 2020-21 FIH Pro League (worldwide)</li><li>9th - 2019 FIH Pro League (worldwide)</li><li>2019 FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifier (Bhubaneswar, India)</li><li>2022-23 FIH Pro League (worldwide), Named Player of the Match against Australia on March 1</li></ul><h5>Olympic Experience</h5><ul><li>1-time Olympian;</li><ul><li>Olympic Games Paris 2024, (Team - Women)</li></ul></ul>","5' 10""",10/1/1997,26,Houston,TX,St. John' School ('16) Stanford University ('20),Stanford University,0,0,0,Field Hockey,https://res.cloudinary.com/usopc-prod/image/upload/v1680011588/TeamUSA%20Assets/Athlete%20Profiles/Kelsey%20Bing%20854664/Bing_150x250.jpg,,

She thought it'd be nice to put some muscle on as a high school freshman. She showed up on her first day as a 4'10”, 78-pound kid and watched practice from the launch as they explained the role of a coxswain to her. She was intrigued but significantly more interested in the rowing portion, so she asked her novice coach when she would get to learn to row. She looked Nina up and down and said, ""Let me check on that."" and never followed up again. </p></li><li>Lists her college coach, Yaz Farooq, as one of her personal heroes. Farooq taught Nina how to be a good leader, a good teammate, but most importantly, she shaped Nina’s perspective on rowing. She showed Nina the value of empowering women through this sport and bringing up those around you in the process – even those on opposing teams. </li><li>Lists the women's eight at the 2012 Olympics as her most memorable Olympic moment. She remembers her high school coach showing her the race four years after it had happened, in an attempt to show her ""the blueprint"" for effective rowing.
