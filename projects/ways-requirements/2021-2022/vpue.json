But what is the purpose of this journey? Why go to college? Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary,  that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation with more recent works. We will consider the relevance of liberal education to all areas of study, from STEM to the arts, and its relations to future careers. And we will examine the central place that the idea of 'the good life' has historically enjoyed in theories of liberal education. You will be prompted to examine your own life, to question how and why you make decisions, and to argue for your views while respecting those of others. Maybe you will conclude that a liberal education is no longer relevant in the twenty-first century, but we hope that you will do so armed with a thorough understanding of what it has been and what it can be.  In the end, college is less about what you will do in life, than about what kind of person you will be. So: what kind of person do you want to be? What kind of life will you live? Join us as we explore what others have said about these questions and prepare to answer them for yourself.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter

How have people excluded from citizenship fought for, and sometimes won, inclusion? These debates have a long history, featuring in some of the earliest recorded philosophy and literature but also animating current political debates in the United States and elsewhere.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Pride parades and marriage rights have become emblems of a  global movement that seems to transcend culture. This course asks what has allowed LGBTQ+  issues to become leading indicators of a certain kind of liberalization and modernization. What is  the road LGBTQ+ rights took from the Stonewall Inn in 1969 to Pride Parades in Minsk, Kolkata  and Nuuk, Greenland by 2015? This course will introduce students to the concepts and issues that have shaped this  development. But it will also highlight the concepts by which historians, social scientists and  political theorists have interrogated the problematic underbelly of this story of global triumph.  What gets left out when we frame the course of LGBTQ+ history as somehow moving from  Lower Manhattan to the rest of the world? Many academics studying LGBTQ+ history worry  about the eurocentrism inherent in this way of telling the story this way, and about how it  truncates our understanding of LGBTQ+ culture. After all, are LGBTQ+ identities and rights one size-fits-all? Do they become a way for Western nations to once again set the standards by  which others are judged developmentally deficient? In certain societies reference to a 'traditional' national way of thinking about gender and  sexuality is simply a fig leaf for homophobia and transphobia. But in other countries an  international vocabulary of LGBTQ+ identity comes face-to-face with longstanding or newly  emergent configurations of gender and sexuality that look very different. How do we mediate  between those two? At the same time, the way Western societies export their conception of  what LGBTQ+ identity is and why and when it matters tells us something about how Western  Europe and the United States think about these issues themselves? What kinds of rights do  Western nations tend to (or at least claim to) champion? Who gets to have and claim those rights?","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":32464,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":59,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":60,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"1:15:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Adrian","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Daub","middle_name":"","name":"Daub, A.","sunet_id":"daub"},{"first_name":"Maxe","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Crandall","middle_name":"","name":"Crandall, M.","sunet_id":"maxec"}],"location":"200-205","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"12:15:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":31689,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":16,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"3:45:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"},{"first_name":"Dharshani","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Jayasinghe","middle_name":"Lakmali","name":"Jayasinghe, D.","sunet_id":"lakmali"}],"location":"Sweet403","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"2:45:00 PM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":31690,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"5:00:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"},{"first_name":"Dharshani","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Jayasinghe","middle_name":"Lakmali","name":"Jayasinghe, D.","sunet_id":"lakmali"}],"location":"Sweet403","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"05","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":31659,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"12:00:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ruth","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Averbach","middle_name":"","name":"Averbach, R.","sunet_id":"wurl"}],"location":"Lathrop 190","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"11:00:00 AM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":30076,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"10:45:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ruth","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Averbach","middle_name":"","name":"Averbach, R.","sunet_id":"wurl"}],"location":"Lathrop 294","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"9:45:00 AM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":""}],"subject":"COLLEGE","tags":[{"name":"elective","organization":"SOUTHASIA"},{"name":"southasia","organization":"GLOBAL"}],"title":"Globally Queer","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"7":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"104","course_id":223315,"description":"This course takes a global perspective on the human facets driving meat consumption. Using historical, ecological, and anthropological material, we look at the ways meat eating has fundamentally shaped our environment, our health, and our culture. We will draw on examples from Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where systems of social division have been in place for centuries based on the professional relationships of individuals and communities with animal slaughter and butchery. We consider how a range of factors, from religious norms to colonial laws have regulated how meat and animals fit into society often with unexpected results. For instance, attitudes to waste from animal slaughter led to the development of the  abattoir, and ultimately facilitated industrialized meat production. The course will ask students to consider their own consumption or abstinence from meat in light of global systems of ecology and structural inequity.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2021-2022"},"14":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

Socrates and other ancient thinkers examined themselves and found that they did not match up to their own ideals.  They thus set out to transform themselves to achieve a good and happy life.  What is the good life?  How do we change ourselves to live a good and happy life?  How do literature and philosophy help us to understand ourselves and to achieve our social, ethical, and personal ideals? In this class, we examine Socrates and Augustine's lives and ideas.  Each struggled to live a good and happy life.  In each case, they urge us to transform ourselves into better human beings.  The first half of the course focuses on the Athenian Socrates, who was put to death because he rejected traditional Greek ideals and and proclaimed a new kind of ethical goodness.  The second half focuses on the North African Augustine, an unhappy soul who became a new man by converting to Christianity.  These thinkers addressed questions and problems that we still confront today:  What do we consider to be a happy life?  Do we need to be good and ethical people to live happily?  Is there one correct set of values?  How do we accommodate other people's beliefs?  Is it possible to experience a transformation of the self?

For the Greeks, tragic plays offered the truth about life's calamities and horrors.  The Greeks enjoyed these plays because the dramatic artistry made beauty out of horror and suffering.  The Greeks did not believe that they controlled their fates.  The Greeks had a &quot;tragic wisdom&quot; that enabled them to confront the hardships of life and the inevitability of death.  This helped them to develop courage and resilience.  Plato attacked this view and introduced a new kind of hero, the philosopher Socrates.  As Plato claimed, we can control our fates by practicing philosophy:  this enables us to become wise and ethically good.  The philosopher strives for this goodness, which is beautiful in the highest possible way--it is our soul's true desire.  Our inner goodness is under our control, so the good and wise person will stay happy even when calamities strike.  Plato's optimistic philosophy flew in the face of Greek tragic wisdom.  Plato offered a new way of living, one based on higher education, the development of knowledge, and the pursuit of true beauty and goodness.  Do we believe that liberal education improves us ethically?  Do we feel optimistic or pessimistic about life?  To what extent can we control our lives and fates?  How do tragic plays, movies, or TV shows represent the horrors that happen in the real world?  Does the art that makes them beautiful and pleasurable help us to confront these horrors?

All ethical systems train the individual to relinquish self-interest in favor of a larger communal good. When you applied to Stanford, you answered many application questions designed to elicit evidence of your ability to serve others, which is considered a sign of good character, leadership, and ability to thrive beyond the confines of your family and private world. Knowing you've wrestled with this question at length, showing sacrifice, endurance, empathy, and understanding of higher goods, this course asks you to examine the nation's view. How can the nation present itself as worthy of your personal sacrifice? Do you need to believe in the greatness of your nation to serve? What kind of cause demands your devotion? Nations have differently articulated such a commitment. Some make modest demands and promise you your own sovereignty. Others request only that you dream of national greatness as your own and that you lend a hand. But all nations require at some point, everything from you. What and when are you prepared to give?

All ethical systems train the individual to relinquish self-interest in favor of a larger communal good. When you applied to Stanford, you answered many application questions designed to elicit evidence of your ability to serve others, which is considered a sign of good character, leadership, and ability to thrive beyond the confines of your family and private world. Knowing you've wrestled with this question at length, showing sacrifice, endurance, empathy, and understanding of higher goods, this course asks you to examine the nation's view. How can the nation present itself as worthy of your personal sacrifice? Do you need to believe in the greatness of your nation to serve? What kind of cause demands your devotion? Nations have differently articulated such a commitment. Some make modest demands and promise you your own sovereignty. Others request only that you dream of national greatness as your own and that you lend a hand. But all nations require at some point, everything from you. What and when are you prepared to give?

We will be entering the conversation in media res, as it were, since all of these pairs have histories together; they've had studio visits, late-night phone calls, email and text conversations. Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work. In advance of each conversation, students will read about something written by the scholar\/critic about the artist. Each artist will also design a short art-making prompt for enrolled students to complete and share through the course website. Students will share their artworks weekly in small critique groups.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":34674,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"05","term":"2021-2022 Winter","units":"1-2"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":17667,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meeting will take place in Burbank Hall.

In Jordan, the Eastern civilizations of Ammon, Moab, Canaan, Assyria, and Babylon thrived as did the Romans and the Persians. Today, the most visible of Jordan's ancient world are the Roman, Nabatean, and Islamic civilizations. The proposed course takes cultural artifacts as the foundational blocks of the Levant, asking a fundamental question about how a contemporary state exists on top and beside the ancient past, by exploring three cities: Petra, Jerash, and Amman. All three cities have large Amphitheatres that suggest a particular pattern of growth over time, and play a major role in how these cities function today as tourist attractions and geography for performances of everyday life. In these three case studies, students will investigate how theatre and performance, along with culture in its broadest definition, have shaped the destiny of the Levant historically and the present-day Hashemite Kingdom. We will ask: How did three major metropolitan cities that stretch back to antiquity develop into very different urban living spaces today? Why do all of them have a massive theatrical space in their midst? What conclusions can be drawn from the stunted development of Petra, the semi-developed city of Jerash, and the highly developed capital city, Amman, based on the position and the level of activity in their theatrical spaces over time?","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":35010,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":0,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":"2"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":24036,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Course Dates: August 27 - September 16, 2022.

In this Bing Overseas Seminar, Stanford students will travel to Tamba to undertake an intensive introduction to forming and firing clay.  Lectures, discussions and studio demos will build a broad view of traditional aesthetic elements of yakishime, but at the same time, students will be encouraged to explore a modern individualistic approach to creative process to help them develop their own expressive forms.  The seminar culminates in a traditional wood firing reaching kiln temperatures in excess of 2300F, which is a process that one must experience first-hand to viscerally comprehend.

Topics for particular study could include &quot;expressionism,&quot; &quot;phenomenology,&quot; &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit,&quot; the Bauhaus, &quot;epic theater,&quot; proletarian art, and early German cinema, more or less following the organization of the Sourcebook.  The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.  Students will be encouraged to base their written projects on these events and on research at local archives, such as the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bauhaus-Museum.  Trips to institutions in other cities (Dessau, Weimar, etc.) could also be considered.  Primarily in English, but some topics might require German. n nThe Symphony  Material covered in this independent study could be adjusted to the student's interest and knowledge,  depending on his\/her level of musical literacy.  He\/she could focus on cultural history or on more technical, analytical  issues.  The aim will be to trace the history of the genre from its roots in the early 18th century to the present day using  mainly works from the established repertory as examples.  Visits to live performances in Berlin may also be included. n nBeethoven in German Culture  Following last year's elections in Germany, the draft coalition contract included the  following statement: &quot;The 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in 2020 offers excellent opportunities for profiling  German culture at home and abroad. Preparing for this important anniversary is thus of national concern.&quot; How and why  did Beethoven become so crucially important in German culture?

War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five core questions: Why do states go to war and what could be the basis for a lasting peace? If war is unavoidable, what is the role of morality in war? How can\/should the world be governed in the absence of a world state? How has international politics been transformed by capitalism?

Drawing on discourses in Body politics, feminist theories of health and medical anthropological approaches to research, this seminar series seeks to question and explore the nature of health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Essentially, it provides an intersectional exploration into how health is comparatively conceptualised using anthropology as the model of analysis.  The series is presented discursively and students' lived-experience and critical reflections are welcomed. Topics covered in the course include anthropological configurations of  'the body' (including phenomenology and biopower) as well as the history and geography of medicine (something of a broad sweep of the impact of European medicinal encounters in Africa). The theoretical approach adopted will consider postcolonial theory, development theory, and feminist theories to unpack health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Typical to studies in health and well-being, the seminar series is interdisciplinary in its delivery and students are encouraged to engage critically with a broad range of literature and texts in order to grapple with the content. Thus, there are no prerequisites for doing the course and we welcome students with varying majors.

Through Fugard's plays, students confront signifcant issues in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Set in the confines of the theater, these confrontations paradoxically generate a fuller engagement with the issues than we often get from accounts in the disciplines of history orpolitcal science. As Picasso once said, &quot;Art is the lie that tells the truth,&quot; and Fugard's theater tries to do that. In studying his plays, students will learn a different kind of truth about social and historical realities that have faced South Africans over the past six decades.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":31848,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPCPTWN","tags":[],"title":"In and Out of the Margins: The Plays of Athol Fugard","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"150":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGCAPE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"36","course_id":209971,"description":"Archaeology, history and ethnography of the aboriginal hunter gatherers of southern Africa, the San people.

Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers.

From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to glory; Boccaccio's love, so sensual and yet so deeply rooted in the human soul as to cause the greatest joy or the deepest despair; Ariosto's love, a dangerous force that can drive people to madness in a world where, after all, everyone is somehow in love and therefore partly (and delightfully) crazy; Machiavelli's love, which can sharpen one's wits and bring with it great achievements, unless it clouds one's judgement and leads to failure; Aretino's love, so unabashedly physical and graphically explicit as to cause scandal and amazement all over Europe. We will also look at how love is described by Veronica Gambara, Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa and other women poets of the Renaissance who renewed the lyrical code from within, giving new meanings to old words. We will also listen to the various kinds of love put to music in operas from Don Giovanni to Traviata and Boh&egrave;me, and we will investigate how love interrelates with history in Manzoni's Promessi sposi and other Romantic historical novels. Finally, we will explore how the previous (male) narratives about love were reconfigured and reinvented by female novelists of the 20th century such as Goliarda Sapienza, Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante, who will lead us to delve into Elena Ferrante's works, where love constantly interplays with friendship, and often confirms that, for better or for worse, appearances can be deceiving.

The module deals with the origin, development and evolution of Made in Italy by approaching its main characteristics, i.e. creativity, innovation and exclusivity. The course will offer students a comprehensive overview of the Made in Italy concept, of its actual implementation and present evolution within a globalized economy, looking in particular at the territorial dimension in the specific case of Tuscany and Florence. Students will be exposed to the fundamental theories relevant to understand the Made in Italy phenomenon but also to &quot;live cases&quot; related to Italian success stories that characterize Italian reputation.

The aim of the course is to work through a variety of disciplinary approaches, from history to sociology to political philosophy, to learn to critically employ the concepts of gender, race, and nation by understanding their relationality, reciprocity, and their specific application in the field of contemporary Italian history. The course therefore includes a first part of work on the conceptual history of gender and race as well as their roots and key articulations in political history and modern philosophical thought. The work focuses on the main texts and authors of critical political thought on race and gender, with particular reference to Black feminist epistemology, decolonial philosophy and critical race theories. Critical analysis of primary sources and moments of collective debates will cross the learning path. The second part focuses on Italy as a gendered and colonial construction both in material and symbolic terms. Sources from feminist philosophy, political sociology, and Italian colonial and postcolonial history will provide tools for critical analysis and guided exercises. The third part will involve the applicative use of the whole conceptual apparatus. Participatory research and social inquiry will pivot on some past and present biographical trajectories of historical and political significance in contemporary Italian history from an intersectional perspective. The historical and social framework in which biographies are inscribed will provide a critical application field for the conceptual apparatus mastered during the course.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":40877,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 3, 2021","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Marie","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Moise","middle_name":"","name":"Moise, M.","sunet_id":"m4moise"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 20, 2021","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[],"title":"\"Brothers of Italy\": The Gendered and Racial Making of the Italian Nation","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"212":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"AII"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Creative Expression (CE)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"CE"}],"code":"96","course_id":221220,"description":"In this 500th anniversary year of the death of Leonardo this class will be an immersive and interactive experience with this most remarkable and complex artist and thinker.

Leonardo's conviction that the soul was the point of convergence of all the senses, prompted him to ponder how sensory information is received and processed. His writings foreshadow gestalt psychology and psychoacoustics centuries before these were studied by scientists. Leonardo's fascination with perception and emotion are manifest in his art and in his inventions.

By the 16th century, when Europeans reached East Asia, China's Ming Dynasty and Japan's Muromachi Shogunate ruled over two of the most populous, urbanized, and sophisticated societies in the world with China the superior regional power. In the late 19th century, that longstanding status quo was abruptly upended. European and American steamships dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had begun its modernization and march to empire. Using short primary sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents) and field trips, we will study the dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies, highlighting connections and contrasts, as well as the impact that each has had on the other. How did Sino-Japanese relations in the early modern era lay the foundations for the current fraught relationship between these two East Asian powers? Confucianism, and the Chinese model of statecraft, which can be seen in the temples and other historical sites of Kyoto, as well as in the layout of the city (modeled on the Tang capital of Chang'an).  By the 16th century, when European merchants and missionaries first reached East Asia, the Ming Empire and the Muromachi Shogunate comprised two of the most  populous, urbanized, economically advanced, and culturally sophisticated societies in the world-with China clearly the  superior regional power.  By the early twentieth century, that status quo had been turned on its head.  European and  American steamships now dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had  begun its modernization and march to empire. Japan's defeat of China in 1895 marked its debut as a major power; soon  Japan would seize Korea and begin encroaching on China's Manchurian territories. Using textual sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents in English translation), as well as field trips to historical sites and museums, we will study the historical dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies during these  centuries, highlighting their connections and contrasts, as well as the profound impact that each has had on the other.

This course will examine emotions from a cross cultural perspective and has three course objectives: (1) to increase students' awareness of how cultural ideas and practices shape their emotions by comparing their experiences in Kyoto with those in the U.S., (2) to teach students to apply a scientific understanding of culture and emotion to their experiences in Kyoto, and (3) to teach students how to formulate and test hypotheses about emotions in Japan vs. U.S. The proposed course will be comprised of three sections. The first section will focus on dominant theories of culture and emotions and the ways in which they are scientifically measured using a variety of self-report, behavioral, and physiological\/neural measures. The second section  will cover three patterns that emerge from the scientific literature regarding U.S.-East Asian differences in the focus of emotion, views of emotional expression, and values regarding emotional experience. Because much of the literature on culture and emotion focuses on U.S. and Japanese comparisons, the empirical findings will be directly applicable to the students studying at Kyoto. The third section will focus on the role of culture and emotion in applied settings (work, educational, and clinical) in the US and Japan. Students' structured and unstructured experiences and observations living in Kyoto will be the basis of our class discussions and will be linked to course material. For instance, students may be asked to analyze the themes and narratives of popular Japanese anime, art, and architecture based on methods introduced in class. As a comparison, students will identify products and practices in the U.S. that illustrate similarities and differences between the two cultures.

Quite simply, Darwin and Wallace needed the access to the tropics that opened up with the Age of Discovery in order to recognize the mechanisms of evolution. Class sessions will alternate between discussions and lectures. However, rather than modern primary literature or textbooks, the readings will come from three classic texts: Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle (1839), Henry Walter Bates' The Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863), and Alfred Russel Wallace's Malay Archipelago (1869). These three books cover much of the geography of the Iberian colonies founded in the Age of Discovery: respectively, Spanish South America and the Portuguese Amazon and Southeast Asia. No matter what &quot;mid-19th century popular science\/travelogue&quot; might suggest, these books are highly readable and show how insights sprang from individuals who confronted a newly available world with rigorous curiosity. (And they also highlight how much the tropics have changed and how oblivious people can be to the consequences of their actions.) The lectures will then bring up to date the science that developed from the explorations described in the texts. And Spain is the perfect location for a local focus to demonstrate the enormity of the geologic forces involved in what can otherwise feel like biogeographic abstractions.

We will apply range of scholarly approaches to these works and their lives on film and in the theatre, including close reading, performance studies, critical race studies, queer studies, and gender studies. Students will be introduced to these methodological frameworks early in the course, and are free to apply any of them in their assignments. Throughout our exploration of these canonical works, we will consider how today's theatre and film makers, as well as their audiences, engage with these plays to make new meanings and interventions in contemporary culture. Central to our discussion will be an interrogation of the place of Shakespeare in contemporary British culture, chiefly through analysis of performances of his plays and those of his contemporaries in major national institutions: Shakespeare's Globe, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC, and the mainstream film industry. At the same time, however, we will be equally concerned with how marginalised groups, including minority ethnic and queer artists, have turned to Shakespeare's plays in order to reposition his works, and themselves, on the global and political stage. These in-class discussions, supported by study-group preparation, will prepare students for the written assignments, which are designed to allow students to interpret these plays and their theatrical\/filmic afterlives, with a particular focus on the social and political implications of staging and screening these plays in today's diverse British society. Each week, students will be expected to have read the set text (a play by either Shakespeare or his contemporaries) and, in one of three 'study groups,' to have engaged with a critical or interpretative response to that text based on assigned reading or viewing (usually a scholarly reading, or a film or theatrical adaptation).","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":12185,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Summer","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"taps","organization":"OSP"}],"title":"Shakespeare and Performance","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"348":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"}],"code":"61","course_id":223281,"description":"What is it like to start your own company?

The art of 1960s countercultural contestation - anti-capitalist, anti-colonial, feminist, etc.--will then be studied, before examining recent initiatives in the realm of commemorative art and cultural display that approach issues facing contemporary French society today, including terrorism and constructively confronting its colonial legacy.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":33346,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 11, 2022","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"audrey","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"calefas-strebelle","middle_name":"","name":"calefas-strebelle, a.","sunet_id":"acalefas"},{"first_name":"Amanda","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Herold","middle_name":"Gerard","name":"Herold, A.","sunet_id":"agherold"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 3, 2022","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[{"name":"minor","organization":"ARTINST"}],"title":"Art and Politics in Modern France","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"428":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"30","course_id":210122,"description":"Multiple artistic trends and esthetic theories from Baudelaire to the Nouveau Roman, from the Surrealists to Oulipo, from the theater of cruelty to the theater of the absurd, from the Impressionists to Yves Klein.

This comparative approach to media and film will encourage students to analyze the ethical stakes surrounding creative and editorial decisions in France and the United States. Through visits to television sets and control rooms, interviews with producers and directors, and screenings of documentaries and films, students will learn to decipher French culture through the specific storytelling techniques used in news reports, series, documentaries and films. Each class session will focus on a television program, news broadcast, documentary or fiction film. Industry professionals working in television and film will be invited to class to share their expertise and interact with students. With more than 373 movie theaters located throughout 20 arrondissements, Paris, is truly the world capital of Cinema. Approximately a hundred theaters are considered independent movie houses, some of which are classified as historical monuments. This unique situation will allow students to learn about the origins of cinema and the importance of film to French culture during class field trips. The professor will provide technical guidance about news reporting and film production in general and how to make a short documentary. As a final project each student will create a personal 2-3 minute short film using their smart phone about a theme relating to their time in Paris. Class time will be spent on finding a story idea, creating an outline, and filming and editing their film.

We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing.  This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics.

The objective of this course is to better understand the food system of a large citysuch as Paris, with a focus on the underlying human-environment interactions. Part I of the course will focus on food production in the peri-urban areas of Paris and other regions in France. 70% of the food consumed in Paris comes from France. We will start with von Thunen's model of the central state.We will also discuss the rise of urban agriculture, with a field visit of an urban agriculture site under the municipality's &quot;Parisculteurs&quot;program. Part II will focus on food distribution and consumption in the city. We will discuss concepts such as agglomeration economies and supply chains. We will conduct interviews atan open-air market in Paris where &laquo;mara&icirc;chers&raquo; bring in their own production to sell. Part III will focus on recent trends to increase the sustainability of food production in France. We will discuss emerging social norms related to sustainable food and how they interact with agricultural and environmental policies in France and the European Union. This will include the rise of organic agriculture, geographical indications, various public and private eco-labeling initiatives, and attitudes toward genetically-modified crops in France.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"}],"title":"FOOD CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"446":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"67","course_id":222943,"description":"The following topics areproposed for an independent study: (1)Land use history in France:After centuries of deforestation, French landscapes have been reforesting for more than a century.

The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class. Issues of resilience will be discussed in relation to major disasters including floods, extreme storms and climate change. The 7 global resilience targets will be identified according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The major components of resilience will be reviewed in class followed by a visit to or by a representative from the 100 Resilient City Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Superstorm Sandy in 2012 will be used as a case study to identify the disaster impact to the urban environment in NYC. We will discuss the emergency response of the City after Sandy and assess the performance of the NYC resilience plan. We will explore how New York City is preparing to respond and recover from future major disasters as part of the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. n nNovel technologies will be discussed in terms of their implications for disaster resilience and sustainability.

How do art, activism and racial justice connect in performances aimed at changing ideas?  How do major arts institutions address questions of equity and difference?

In doing so, we will grapple with the role of the creative arts in mitigating social change and study artists who have sought to intervene in the restrictive covenants of racial, gender and other segregationist or national orders.

We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

We will then discuss the development of new treatments for cancer as well as measures to screen for and prevent cancer, including the ongoing debate over tobacco control. Using cancer as a case study, you will learn important aspects of the scientific method including experimental design, data analysis, and the difference between correlation and causation.

In 1865, the peace treaty was signed at Appomattox and the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but the battle over memory and national identity had just begun.  The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today.  We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music.  Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories? And in what ways?

In this course we will examine the classical roots, medieval developments, and contemporary permutations of Western ideas of romantic love. With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender. We discuss these works of the past, for example the illicit love in the courtly romance Tristan, in tandem with representations of clandestine love from the present day, such as the portrayal of same-sex love in Brokeback Mountain.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"acquire an understanding of the history and traditions of diverse groups of people and how social differences have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"What is Love?","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"603":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"AII"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"}],"code":"44","course_id":215408,"description":"Why do people believe in God? What does it mean for people to experience the supernatural? How do we understand belief in God? How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others? In this course we ask the big (and unanswerable) question why people believe in God. Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"critically evaluate primary and secondary source materials, and use both to explain social and historical phenomena."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Belief","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"604":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Scientific Method and Analysis (SMA)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SMA"}],"code":"45","course_id":215409,"description":"What is the origin and ultimate fate of the universe?

In this course, students will explore questions about the Universe, its beginnings, its structure, its extent, its fate, from several perspectives - philosophical, experimental, and theoretical.

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"evaluate how existing social arrangements create and maintain social differences among people."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"assess and synthesize evidence about programs and interventions designed to promote diversity and inclusion."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"ccguide","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"PDCert","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"all","organization":"FEMST"}],"title":"Why So Few?

We aim to teach students how to identify and think about these conflicts and how to craft arguments, both written and oral, in support of their positions, using a variety of source materials.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-ER"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"issues","organization":"HUMRTS"}],"title":"Justice and the University","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"621":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"AII"}],"code":"64","course_id":220166,"description":"This course focuses on multiple genres of narratives about illness and recovery: memoirs, graphic novels, poetry, fiction, essay, and documentary film.

find ourselves in an age of rapidly evolving technology, where the world we inhabit, increasingly, is the world we make.

What is rarer is to be given the space to stop and really think about why&iquest;for what and for whom&iquest;we design these things, and whether we should continue to design in ways demanded by commercial and political actors.  This critical thinking course examines the nature, purpose, and meaning of design in human life, and asks the fundamental questions of &iquest;what is design?&iquest;, &iquest;why do we do it?&iquest;, and &iquest;how do design, technology, and society shape one another?&iquest;. We will explore design as a series of choices and the ways in which we make these choices. This course will consider different models of design in our world today: from need-based design (as we are often taught) to the fashioning of tools that help us flourish as human beings. You will learn about various aesthetic and ethical frameworks and a fundamental language of design, so that you can begin to critically analyze everyday examples of media, tools, toys, and games&iquest;and apply such lenses to designing conscientiously. You will learn to think about the design of social networks, artificial intelligence, musical instruments, games, virtual reality, and other examples&iquest;in terms of needs and values, ethics and aesthetics. In short, through this course, you will learn to more clearly and critically view our technology-drenched human world&iquest;and to exercise your ethical and artful imagination to reimagine better worlds.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Classical music means different things to different people. For some it connotes Western art music of a particular historical era. According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free.

Have you ever noticed that you change the way you speak to present a particular social identity? For example, have you ever switched between dialects or languages to show alignment with certain social groups or mark your 'in-group' status? Because language is flexible (and somewhat controllable), it can be used as a resource to create and index identity. However, given its flexible nature, criticizing someone's language often becomes a more socially acceptable way of attacking someone than something that seems like bald-faced racism\/sexism\/homophobia, etc.  In this course we'll explore this complex link between identity and language.nnThis course explores the way language and social identity are defined, discussed, and debated in America, and the assumptions this rhetoric presents about race, class, education and other social identities more broadly.  Together, we&iquest;ll consider: What's it like to grow up monolingual versus bilingual or multilingual? What role do our ethnicity and\/or race play in how our language skills are perceived? What role do language attitudes and stereotypes play in influencing our daily lives? What role does the media play? How is language discussed in politics? Students will be able to work on a research project related to social identity and language on a topic of their choice.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: The Rhetoric of Language and Social Identity in America","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"701":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"1IY","course_id":217354,"description":"Rhetorical and contextual analysis of readings; research; and argument.

In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family?","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: It's All Relative: The Rhetoric of the Modern American Family","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2021-2022"},"771":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1 Requirement","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"1WG","course_id":210546,"description":"Rhetorical analysis of readings, research, and argument.

Despite our fascination with extreme acts of violence, those who study the nature of illegality know the opposite to be true: Far from a problem of murder, crime is instead predominantly composed of everyday acts of offense that never garner police attention, such as tax evasion, the violation of environmental regulations, computer hacking, and recreational drug use. Critical criminologists term this kind of unprosecuted crime &quot;crime's dark figure&quot; because it flies below the radar of public awareness and judicial action. This course will take the divergence between cultural representations of crime and crime's &quot;dark figure&quot; as a point of departure.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story. Students in this course will have a special opportunity to meet personally with poet Billy Collins and singer Aimee Mann when they visit campus in April. Does not fulfill NSC requirement.

In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent.

For many citizens who desire a truly representative government, SCOTUS's decision predicted the collapse of democracy and endorsed White supremacy. In this course, through an examination of jurisprudential racism and misogyny, students will learn to dissect the rhetoric of the U.S. judicial branch and the barriers it constructs to equity and inclusion through caselaw and appellate Opinions. The United States of America long deprived the right to vote to men of color and women of every race, and equal access to justice including at the intersections has been an enduring fight. The history of employment law, criminal justice, access to healthcare, and more includes jurisprudence enforcing racist and misogynist U.S. policies and social dynamics. Students will learn how to read a case, scrutinize court briefings, and contextualize bias as a foundation to erect a more just, equitable, and inclusionary legal system.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":33903,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":3,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":15,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2022","end_time":"5:00:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kathleen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tarr","middle_name":"A.","name":"Tarr, K.","sunet_id":"ktarr"}],"location":"250-108","start_date":"Mar 28, 2022","start_time":"3:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2021-2022 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: Racism, Misogyny, and the Law (CSRE 194KTA, FEMGEN 194, HISTORY 261C)","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2021-2022"},"925":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"194MF","course_id":218176,"description":"Every day a new headline alerts us to the lack of race and gender diversity in the tech sector in Silicon Valley. At the same time, science and technology are often lauded as objective systems capable of producing color- and gender-blind truths and social good for all of us. This course pushes beyond the headlines and the hashtags to think about the complex relationship between gender, race and science. Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced.

But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
