But what is the purpose of this journey? Why go to college? Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary,  that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation with more recent works. We will consider the relevance of liberal education to all areas of study, from STEM to the arts, and its relations to future careers. And we will examine the central place that the idea of 'the good life' has historically enjoyed in theories of liberal education. You will be prompted to examine your own life, to question how and why you make decisions, and to argue for your views while respecting those of others. Maybe you will conclude that a liberal education is no longer relevant in the twenty-first century, but we hope that you will do so armed with a thorough understanding of what it has been and what it can be.  In the end, college is less about what you will do in life, than about what kind of person you will be. So: what kind of person do you want to be? What kind of life will you live? Join us as we explore what others have said about these questions and prepare to answer them for yourself.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Citizenship also means equal membership in a self-governing political community. We will explore some of the many debates about this ideal: Who is (or ought to be) included in citizenship? Who gets to decide? What responsibilities come with citizenship? Is citizenship analogous to being a friend, a family member, a business partner? How have people excluded from citizenship fought for, and sometimes won, inclusion? These debates have a long history, featuring in some of the earliest recorded philosophy and literature but also animating current political debates in the United States and elsewhere.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Pride parades and marriage rights have become emblems of a  global movement that seems to transcend culture. This course asks what has allowed LGBTQ+  issues to become leading indicators of a certain kind of liberalization and modernization. What is  the road LGBTQ+ rights took from the Stonewall Inn in 1969 to Pride Parades in Minsk, Kolkata  and Nuuk, Greenland by 2015? This course will introduce students to the concepts and issues that have shaped this  development. But it will also highlight the concepts by which historians, social scientists and  political theorists have interrogated the problematic underbelly of this story of global triumph.  What gets left out when we frame the course of LGBTQ+ history as somehow moving from  Lower Manhattan to the rest of the world? Many academics studying LGBTQ+ history worry  about the eurocentrism inherent in this way of telling the story this way, and about how it  truncates our understanding of LGBTQ+ culture. After all, are LGBTQ+ identities and rights one size-fits-all? Do they become a way for Western nations to once again set the standards by  which others are judged developmentally deficient? In certain societies reference to a 'traditional' national way of thinking about gender and  sexuality is simply a fig leaf for homophobia and transphobia. But in other countries an  international vocabulary of LGBTQ+ identity comes face-to-face with longstanding or newly  emergent configurations of gender and sexuality that look very different. How do we mediate  between those two? At the same time, the way Western societies export their conception of  what LGBTQ+ identity is and why and when it matters tells us something about how Western  Europe and the United States think about these issues themselves? What kinds of rights do  Western nations tend to (or at least claim to) champion? Who gets to have and claim those rights?","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"COLLEGE","tags":[{"name":"elective","organization":"SOUTHASIA"},{"name":"southasia","organization":"GLOBAL"}],"title":"Globally Queer","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"8":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"104","course_id":223315,"description":"This course takes a global perspective on the human facets driving meat consumption. Using historical, ecological, and anthropological material, we look at the ways meat eating has fundamentally shaped our environment, our health, and our culture. We will draw on examples from Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where systems of social division have been in place for centuries based on the professional relationships of individuals and communities with animal slaughter and butchery. We consider how a range of factors, from religious norms to colonial laws have regulated how meat and animals fit into society often with unexpected results. For instance, attitudes to waste from animal slaughter led to the development of the  abattoir, and ultimately facilitated industrialized meat production.

of all species that have ever inhabited Earth are now extinct, including 12 species  of the genus Homo. The threat of human extinction is global, and it is driven by social,  economic, technological and political forces operating at global scales. This course will  explore several plausible scenarios by which human extinction (or near-extinction) could  occur within the next 100 years. In this course, we will study the psychological, social,  political, economic and epistemological barriers that frequently derail efforts to avert  these catastrophes. We will explore diverse approaches to understanding these risks,  strategies that could reduce them, and better ways to think and act as we move into an  uncertain future. Students will engage these issues through academic reading, apocalyptic  fiction, group discussion and writing. We will consider the role of human agency in the  evolution of these risks and their prevention, and our responsibilities as 21st-century  citizens.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

relief of pain and suffering is considered one of the primary aims of medicine. However, what suffering is and what physicians must do specifically to prevent or relieve it is not well understood or explained. While suffering may be inherent to the human experience, the ways that suffering is perceived, experienced and addressed are heavily influenced by culture, beliefs and local resources. In this course, we will examine how patients and medical practitioners in different countries make meaning from the experience of pain and suffering of illness. We will draw from narratives and scholarly texts in order to explore how understandings of pain and suffering are shaped by social, cultural, economic and personal factors. Through an examination of personal, cultural and social practices related to suffering and medicine, we also develop skills for reflecting upon how one's culture and personal context influence how they make meaning of illness and suffering.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

The course places American democracy in a global and comparative perspective, noting the distinctive features and challenges of U.S. democracy and the wide variety of other democratic institutional forms in the world. It deals both with competing visions of what democracy might be and their actual realization around the world. A major element of the course is to consider different conceptual approaches to democracy-direct, representative, participatory, and deliberative. How do different political systems borrow from these concepts to enhance or justify their forms of governance? How are they evolving or reforming in ways that may address the current crisis of democracy and renew public faith in the efficacy and worth of democracy? Democratic institutions are subject to a living dialogue, and we intend to engage the students in these debates, at the levels of both democratic theory and ongoing democratic practice and institutional designs. In the second half of the course, we will examine innovations like Deliberative Polling and institutional reforms of electoral systems and accountability structures that could increase civic participation, reduce polarization, rein in corruption, and improve the functioning and legitimacy of democracy.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2022-2023"},"21":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

If this were true, it would make self-knowledge perhaps the easiest sort of knowledge to obtain. But there are many considerations that mitigate against this view of self-knowledge. Consider, for example, the slave who is so oppressed that he fully accepts his slavery and cannot even imagine the possibility of freedom for himself.

What is it to decolonize our institutions, minds and politics? In recent years, the Rhodes Must Fall movement in South Africa has spurred on a vibrant and difficult discussion across the world, about the legacy of colonialism in the modern university. Students and academics have been engaged in devising methods to understand and undo this colonial inheritance and confront the various connected structures of power such as hetero-patriarchy, racism, and class. One aspect of this endeavor has been to delve deep into the intellectual resources developed by anti-colonial and decolonial writers, revolutionaries, academics, and activists from the postcolonial world. This course is designed as a deep engagement with this critical decolonial work by some of the most significant thinkers from the Global South in the last hundred years. We will begin the course by developing a basic understanding of the contemporary call for decolonizing the university and the field of postcolonial and decolonial scholarship. After this, the main focus of this course will be a close reading and reflection on the writings that today constitute a rich reservoir of ideas for contemporary struggles to decolonize, to think critically about structures of power and injustice and to search for languages of liberation.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18824,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 9, 2022","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Mutallip","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Anwar","middle_name":"","name":"Anwar, M.","sunet_id":"manwar"}],"location":"160-332","start_date":"Sep 26, 2022","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2022-2023 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18825,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Tuesday seminar will be held in 80-113.

What is it to decolonize our institutions, minds and politics? In recent years, the Rhodes Must Fall movement in South Africa has spurred on a vibrant and difficult discussion across the world, about the legacy of colonialism in the modern university. Students and academics have been engaged in devising methods to understand and undo this colonial inheritance and confront the various connected structures of power such as hetero-patriarchy, racism, and class. One aspect of this endeavor has been to delve deep into the intellectual resources developed by anti-colonial and decolonial writers, revolutionaries, academics, and activists from the postcolonial world.

Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work. In advance of each conversation, students will read about something written by the scholar\/critic about the artist. Each artist will also design a short art-making prompt for enrolled students to complete and share through the course website.

Although it might be easy to assume that art is made out of materials close at hand and seen or experienced chiefly by local makers, artists have often sought out distant materials and unfamiliar ideas, which are prized for their scarcity or their very distance from what is local and familiar. Historically these movements have revealed global power structures, as well as local interest and agency in ways that can be both far reaching and narrowly focused. Globalization is commonly equated with contemporary multinational corporations, from Apple to Amazon to AliExpress, but earlier periods of global exchange have also materially shaped what art is and can be. Art can reflect and reveal a global movement of peoples and ideas, as well as the raw materials that make art possible - whether words, woods, animals, minerals or melodies. We will focus in this class on a series of case studies that explore how art moves - and why these movements move artists and the people who are influenced by their work. Lectures will feature scholars and artists who address aspects of global exchange or movement in their work. In a series of workshops, students will work towards creating a genealogical project that similarly investigates how origins and movement have enabled and inspired art-making. We think of the class as an atlas for your own investigations into how art moves and how it may move you.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"take creative risks beyond their comfort zones."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"explore their own potential to produce original creative projects."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"engage in artistic collaboration and the creative reinterpretation of art made by others."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"consider multiple and possibly divergent solutions to a problem."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"explore the role of artistic expression in addressing issues that face society."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"evaluate how existing social arrangements create and maintain social differences among people."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":31738,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":43,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PLEASE NOTE: Lectures will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Burbank Lecture Theater from 11:00 AM to 12:00PM n.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 7, 2023","end_time":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Karla","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Oeler","middle_name":"","name":"Oeler, K.","sunet_id":"koeler"},{"first_name":"Kim","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Beil","middle_name":"","name":"Beil, K.","sunet_id":"kbeil"},{"first_name":"Samuel","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Sax","middle_name":"","name":"Sax, S.","sunet_id":"samsax"}],"location":"Departmental Room","start_date":"Apr 3, 2023","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Spring","units":"3"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":31739,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"ITALIC 93-02 | Section Instructor: Sam Sax| Schedule: Tuesdays, 1:30 PM -

The proposed course takes cultural artifacts as the foundational blocks of the Levant, asking a fundamental question about how a contemporary state exists on top and beside the ancient past, by exploring three cities: Petra, Jerash, and Amman. All three cities have large Amphitheatres that suggest a particular pattern of growth over time, and play a major role in how these cities function today as tourist attractions and geography for performances of everyday life. In these three case studies, students will investigate how theatre and performance, along with culture in its broadest definition, have shaped the destiny of the Levant historically and the present-day Hashemite Kingdom. We will ask: How did three major metropolitan cities that stretch back to antiquity develop into very different urban living spaces today? Why do all of them have a massive theatrical space in their midst? What conclusions can be drawn from the stunted development of Petra, the semi-developed city of Jerash, and the highly developed capital city, Amman, based on the position and the level of activity in their theatrical spaces over time?","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPGEN","tags":[{"name":"meca","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Jordanian Futurities between Ancient Antiquities and Performances of Urban Life","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2022-2023"},"96":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"OVERSEAS","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"53","course_id":214075,"description":"Coral reef ecology, biogeochemistry, physics with a view towards developing science-based solutions for coral reef protection and management.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPGEN","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"eenr","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Corals of Palau: Ecology, the Physical Environment, and Reefs at Risk","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2022-2023"},"97":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"OVERSEAS","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"code":"58","course_id":222230,"description":"The Tamba region near Kyoto, Japan, has been a center of pottery production for over eight centuries.

Lectures, discussions and studio demos will build a broad view of traditional aesthetic elements of yakishime, but at the same time, students will be encouraged to explore a modern individualistic approach to creative process to help them develop their own expressive forms.

Topics for particular study could include &quot;expressionism,&quot; &quot;phenomenology,&quot; &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit,&quot; the Bauhaus, &quot;epic theater,&quot; proletarian art, and early German cinema, more or less following the organization of the Sourcebook.  The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.  Students will be encouraged to base their written projects on these events and on research at local archives, such as the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bauhaus-Museum.  Trips to institutions in other cities (Dessau, Weimar, etc.) could also be considered.  Primarily in English, but some topics might require German. n nThe Symphony  Material covered in this independent study could be adjusted to the student's interest and knowledge,  depending on his\/her level of musical literacy.  He\/she could focus on cultural history or on more technical, analytical  issues.  The aim will be to trace the history of the genre from its roots in the early 18th century to the present day using  mainly works from the established repertory as examples.  Visits to live performances in Berlin may also be included. n nBeethoven in German Culture  Following last year's elections in Germany, the draft coalition contract included the  following statement: &quot;The 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in 2020 offers excellent opportunities for profiling  German culture at home and abroad. Preparing for this important anniversary is thus of national concern.&quot; How and why  did Beethoven become so crucially important in German culture?

With Berlin as our backdrop, pursue these questions by considering three cases in detail: the 1936 Berlin Olympics, East German sport in the 1970s and 1980s, and German soccer today.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPBER","tags":[],"title":"Politics and Organization of Sport in Germany and the US","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"131":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGBERL","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"77","course_id":220108,"description":"International politics is beset by problems. States go to war. The global economy is volatile and unequal. The human community is divided into multiple nation-states. Some states dominate others. People commit acts of evil. Luckily, we are not the first people to have noticed that international politics is not characterized exclusively by peace and harmony. War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five core questions: Why do states go to war and what could be the basis for a lasting peace? If war is unavoidable, what is the role of morality in war? How can\/should the world be governed in the absence of a world state? How has international politics been transformed by capitalism? What role has been and is played by race and racism in international politics?","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":17876,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":9,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Berlin only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 9, 2022","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Karen","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Kramer","middle_name":"","name":"Kramer, K.","sunet_id":"kkramer"},{"first_name":"Matthew","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Stephen","middle_name":"D.","name":"Stephen, M.","sunet_id":"mds123"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2022","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Autumn","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPBER","tags":[{"name":"related","organization":"POLISCI"},{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"ihc","organization":"IR"},{"name":"intnlrel","organization":"OSP"},{"name":"polisci","organization":"OSP"},{"name":"european","organization":"SGS"}],"title":"Understanding Intl' Politics Today:\u00a0From the German Philosophers to Modern Social Science","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"132":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGBERL","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"79","course_id":220402,"description":"Political economy of Germany with special emphasis on contemporary issues.

A few months later, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch provided the theoretical basis for understanding the perplexing experimental results by Hahn and Strassmann and named the process fission. Their discovery, and the fear that Germany was developing nuclear weapons, was the motivation for the U.S. Manhattan Project that lead to the development of and first use of nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Germany, in fact, had its own Uranprojekt and Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor) projects lead by Werner Heisenberg, a leading physicist at that time, but failed to develop a nuclear weapon.

Drawing on discourses in Body politics, feminist theories of health and medical anthropological approaches to research, this seminar series seeks to question and explore the nature of health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Essentially, it provides an intersectional exploration into how health is comparatively conceptualised using anthropology as the model of analysis.  The series is presented discursively and students' lived-experience and critical reflections are welcomed. Topics covered in the course include anthropological configurations of  'the body' (including phenomenology and biopower) as well as the history and geography of medicine (something of a broad sweep of the impact of European medicinal encounters in Africa). The theoretical approach adopted will consider postcolonial theory, development theory, and feminist theories to unpack health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Typical to studies in health and well-being, the seminar series is interdisciplinary in its delivery and students are encouraged to engage critically with a broad range of literature and texts in order to grapple with the content. Thus, there are no prerequisites for doing the course and we welcome students with varying majors.

His innovative dramatic style (drawing orignally on improvisation, Brecht, and Greek tragedy,before shifting into realistic situations and dialogue);his apartheid-challenging collaborations with black South African theater artists (especially Zekes Mokei, John Kani, and Winston N'Tshona);and his extraordinarily long career (over the past sevendecades) makehis work of particular interest to students of history, theater, and politics. Through Fugard's plays, students confront signifcant issues in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa.

Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers.

This course explores the history, culture, and contemporary politics of Italy through the lens of the country's relations with Muslims and Islamic societies in the Mediterranean region. We begin in the first millennium of the common era, when Muslims ruled over large parts of Europe, including Iberia and Sicily. We then move into the Renaissance period to cover Italy's extensive relations with Islamic empires such as the Mamluks of Egypt and the Ottomans of the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa (often simply called, &quot;the Turks&quot;). Moving into the modern period, we will then examine how Italian national identity was moulded in contrast to an imagined Muslim counterpart, tracing how these ideas informed Italian colonialism in North Africa. The last part of the course focuses on contemporary issues: over the past several decades and still today, Italy has maintained particularly close relations with Muslim countries in the region. Nonetheless, immigration and the supposed menace of Islam have come to play a large role in Italian politics today. We will study these topics using a range of sources including first-hand accounts (in translation), art, and film. Key themes in the course include conquest, coexistence, conversion, migration &amp; immigration, trade, colonialism, national identity formation, the Cold War, and global political movements.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":33961,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":4,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":50,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ali","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Karamustafa","middle_name":"Aydin","name":"Karamustafa, A.","sunet_id":"aakaramu"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 9, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Winter","units":"5"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"HISTORY","organization":"ISSTUD"},{"name":"ihc","organization":"IR"},{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"meca","organization":"IR"}],"title":"\"Help - It's the Turks!: Italy and the Islamic Mediterranean","units_max":5,"units_min":5,"year":"2022-2023"},"187":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"21F","course_id":202547,"description":"Review of grammatical structures; grammar in its communicative context.

Fashion entangles creativity, culture, style, and ways of life. At the same time, garment production entails complex and globalized manufacturing processes that tie together segmented labor forces with differentiated levels of work quality, rights, and regions embedded in the world economy in diverse positions and at different levels of their developmental path. Garment manufacturing is an industry forerunner in terms of productive globalization, and it is considered a starter industrial sector for economically underdeveloped regions. Early on, it presented signs of technological revolutions, the growing role of intangible assets over production, and the restructuring dynamics of production in complex, globalized and functionally integrated value chains. The sector, therefore, serves as a guide and a lens to scrutinize wide-ranging phenomena and to engage with broader theoretical debates. By analyzing the garment\/fashion complex, it is possible to study globalizing production and consumption processes, the role of decent work in global production networks, and the crucial issues of economic development and transnational regulations. This course focuses on the literature that deals with garment production in Global Value Chains and explores different analytical approaches in between the theoretical traditions of economic and labor sociology and international political economy. The focus on garments allows students to deepen their knowledge of related and wider issues such as theories of development, feminist political economy, analyses of labor organizations, and the regulations for decent work across national boundaries. The course, therefore, touches upon issues of gendered exploitative mechanisms at work, labor control and surveillance, theories of labor agency and movements within the workplace and across national boundaries, as well as theories of private and public global governance for labor standards. While the course is global in its analytical scope, it pays specific attention to European and especially Italian dynamics. Readings on Italian case studies and current events are presented in almost all the weekly topics and two thematic units are dedicated entirely to an analysis of garment production processes in Prato and in Southern Italy.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18868,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":2,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 9, 2022","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Francesco","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Bagnardi","middle_name":"","name":"Bagnardi, F.","sunet_id":"bagnardi"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2022","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Autumn","units":"5"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[],"title":"Un)fashionable Entanglements: Development, Workers' Movements and Regulation in Global Garment Value","units_max":5,"units_min":5,"year":"2022-2023"},"216":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"64","course_id":221279,"description":"Analysis of colonialism during the 19th century, with particular reference to French colonialism, followed by discussion of the influence of the colonial heritage on current African and Euro-Mediterranean relations.

From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to glory; Boccaccio's love, so sensual and yet so deeply rooted in the human soul as to cause the greatest joy or the deepest despair; Ariosto's love, a dangerous force that can drive people to madness in a world where, after all, everyone is somehow in love and therefore partly (and delightfully) crazy; Machiavelli's love, which can sharpen one's wits and bring with it great achievements, unless it clouds one's judgement and leads to failure; Aretino's love, so unabashedly physical and graphically explicit as to cause scandal and amazement all over Europe. We will also look at how love is described by Veronica Gambara, Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa and other women poets of the Renaissance who renewed the lyrical code from within, giving new meanings to old words. We will also listen to the various kinds of love put to music in operas from Don Giovanni to Traviata and Boh&egrave;me, and we will investigate how love interrelates with history in Manzoni's Promessi sposi and other Romantic historical novels. Finally, we will explore how the previous (male) narratives about love were reconfigured and reinvented by female novelists of the 20th century such as Goliarda Sapienza, Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante, who will lead us to delve into Elena Ferrante's works, where love constantly interplays with friendship, and often confirms that, for better or for worse, appearances can be deceiving.

The module deals with the origin, development and evolution of Made in Italy by approaching its main characteristics, i.e. creativity, innovation and exclusivity. The course will offer students a comprehensive overview of the Made in Italy concept, of its actual implementation and present evolution within a globalized economy, looking in particular at the territorial dimension in the specific case of Tuscany and Florence. Students will be exposed to the fundamental theories relevant to understand the Made in Italy phenomenon but also to &quot;live cases&quot; related to Italian success stories that characterize Italian reputation.

The course therefore includes a first part of work on the conceptual history of gender and race as well as their roots and key articulations in political history and modern philosophical thought. The work focuses on the main texts and authors of critical political thought on race and gender, with particular reference to Black feminist epistemology, decolonial philosophy and critical race theories. Critical analysis of primary sources and moments of collective debates will cross the learning path. The second part focuses on Italy as a gendered and colonial construction both in material and symbolic terms. Sources from feminist philosophy, political sociology, and Italian colonial and postcolonial history will provide tools for critical analysis and guided exercises. The third part will involve the applicative use of the whole conceptual apparatus. Participatory research and social inquiry will pivot on some past and present biographical trajectories of historical and political significance in contemporary Italian history from an intersectional perspective. The historical and social framework in which biographies are inscribed will provide a critical application field for the conceptual apparatus mastered during the course.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18032,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":50,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 9, 2022","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Marie","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Moise","middle_name":"","name":"Moise, M.","sunet_id":"m4moise"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2022","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[],"title":"\"Brothers of Italy\": The Gendered and Racial Making of the Italian Nation","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"233":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"96","course_id":221220,"description":"In this 500th anniversary year of the death of Leonardo this class will be an immersive and interactive experience with this most remarkable and complex artist and thinker.

Leonardo's conviction that the soul was the point of convergence of all the senses, prompted him to ponder how sensory information is received and processed. His writings foreshadow gestalt psychology and psychoacoustics centuries before these were studied by scientists. Leonardo's fascination with perception and emotion are manifest in his art and in his inventions.

Our entry point will be Cesare Beccaria's 1764 treatise, Of Crimes and Punishments, which linked criminal justice reform with the struggle against despotism. Beccaria was a key figure in the Italian Enlightenment, and his treatise laid the foundation for virtually all subsequent efforts at criminal justice reform, in the United States as well as in Europe. Beccaria's ideas heavily influenced the American Revolutionaries, found expression in the Bill of Rights, and continue to shape discussions of policing and punishment today. We will read Beccaria's treatise, as well as secondary materials placing him in historical context and tracing his influence on the reform of criminal justice institutions in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We will also examine a series of contemporary debates about policing, prosecution, and punishment, including calls for prison abolition and for defunding the police, and we will ask what light Beccaria's ideas can throw on those debates.  We will consider, too, the criminal-justice dimensions of the recent rise of populism and nativism, both in the United States and in Europe, and the increasing overlap between debates about crime and debates about immigration. Studying Beccaria will provide a window into the Italian Enlightenment, and tracing his influence will help us place modern debates about mass incarceration, police violence, and prosecutorial discretion in historical perspective. We may take field trips to the sites of former prisons in Florence and to Milan, where Beccaria lived and worked.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19576,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"David","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Sklansky","middle_name":"A","name":"Sklansky, D.","sunet_id":"sklansky"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 9, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Winter","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"comp_gov","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Policing, Punishment and Democracy: Beccaria and the Modern Politics of Crime","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"236":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"111Y","course_id":108213,"description":"Lectures, site visits, and readings reconstruct the circumstances that favored the flowering of architecture, sculpture, and painting in Florence and Italy, late 13th to early 16th century.

Since embarking on its reform andopening-up policy in 1978, China has transformed from a command economy to a market-orientedsystem and achieved over three decades of rapid growth. Chinese society has also undergone an allencompassing socio-cultural change, from a proletarian culture in the Mao era to a burgeoningconsumer culture today. This course will address both the historical processes of cultural changes andmajor consumer issues in contemporary China. It aims to provide a roadmap for students to develop acritical perspective on China's consumer culture. In essence, the class explores what it means tobelong to a consumer society with &quot;Chinese characteristics&quot;. We will start by introducing core concerns,arguments, and approaches related to consumer culture in China. After the introductory sessions, wewill focus, week by week, on common (and oftentimes controversial) consumer issues we encounterin our daily lives. We will read works covering various consumption experiences while paying specialattention to how consumer culture, embedded in the specific economic, political and socio-culturalmilieu of contemporary China constructs our ways of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot;. We will also look into thedetrimental aspects of consumer culture, including its psychological and ethical impacts, class andgender exploitation, and environmental degradation. Students are encouraged to examine their ownconsumer values and behaviors, join in conversation with the existing critics of China's consumerculture, and offer their own reflections.

We will analyse the ways in which historians and anthropologists have used the Mediterranean as a privileged terrain to rethink the communication, circulation and exchanges between the Christian and Muslim worlds, often represented as fundamentally antagonistic.  Although violence is pervasive in the Middle Sea's history, we will see that it was not always religiously motivated. We will thus explore other forms of tension such as wars between empires aspiring for global dominion (Spain and the Ottoman Empire), privateering, the exploitation of captive labour force, slave trade and the wars of colonial conquest. A theatre of multiform conflicts, the Mediterranean was also a crossroads where economic, commercial and political interests intersected. We will thus examine the ways in which these interactions contributed to the formation of multi-religious states and favoured religious syncretism and linguistic and cultural hybridizations. We will finally investigate how nationalism and colonialism compartmentalized the Mediterranean space. Aside from scholarly works, our material will include literature and films.

By the 16th century, when Europeans reached East Asia, China's Ming Dynasty and Japan's Muromachi Shogunate ruled over two of the most populous, urbanized, and sophisticated societies in the world with China the superior regional power. In the late 19th century, that longstanding status quo was abruptly upended. European and American steamships dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had begun its modernization and march to empire. Using short primary sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents) and field trips, we will study the dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies, highlighting connections and contrasts, as well as the impact that each has had on the other. How did Sino-Japanese relations in the early modern era lay the foundations for the current fraught relationship between these two East Asian powers? Confucianism, and the Chinese model of statecraft, which can be seen in the temples and other historical sites of Kyoto, as well as in the layout of the city (modeled on the Tang capital of Chang'an).  By the 16th century, when European merchants and missionaries first reached East Asia, the Ming Empire and the Muromachi Shogunate comprised two of the most  populous, urbanized, economically advanced, and culturally sophisticated societies in the world-with China clearly the  superior regional power.  By the early twentieth century, that status quo had been turned on its head.  European and  American steamships now dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had  begun its modernization and march to empire. Japan's defeat of China in 1895 marked its debut as a major power; soon  Japan would seize Korea and begin encroaching on China's Manchurian territories. Using textual sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents in English translation), as well as field trips to historical sites and museums, we will study the historical dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies during these  centuries, highlighting their connections and contrasts, as well as the profound impact that each has had on the other.

This course will examine emotions from a cross cultural perspective and has three course objectives: (1) to increase students' awareness of how cultural ideas and practices shape their emotions by comparing their experiences in Kyoto with those in the U.S., (2) to teach students to apply a scientific understanding of culture and emotion to their experiences in Kyoto, and (3) to teach students how to formulate and test hypotheses about emotions in Japan vs. U.S. The proposed course will be comprised of three sections. The first section will focus on dominant theories of culture and emotions and the ways in which they are scientifically measured using a variety of self-report, behavioral, and physiological\/neural measures. The second section  will cover three patterns that emerge from the scientific literature regarding U.S.-East Asian differences in the focus of emotion, views of emotional expression, and values regarding emotional experience. Because much of the literature on culture and emotion focuses on U.S. and Japanese comparisons, the empirical findings will be directly applicable to the students studying at Kyoto. The third section will focus on the role of culture and emotion in applied settings (work, educational, and clinical) in the US and Japan. Students' structured and unstructured experiences and observations living in Kyoto will be the basis of our class discussions and will be linked to course material. For instance, students may be asked to analyze the themes and narratives of popular Japanese anime, art, and architecture based on methods introduced in class. As a comparison, students will identify products and practices in the U.S. that illustrate similarities and differences between the two cultures. Students will write short papers each week linking their experiences to the assigned material. At the end of the quarter, students will make short presentations about another aspect of emotion they hypothesize varies in the U.S. and Japan, based on their own experiences in Kyoto, and discuss how they might design a study to test their hypotheses. Readings will include sections from popular books and accessible academic chapters and empirical articles.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18696,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 9, 2022","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jeanne","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tsai","middle_name":"L","name":"Tsai, J.","sunet_id":"jltsai"},{"first_name":"Brian","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Knutson","middle_name":"D","name":"Knutson, B.","sunet_id":"knutson"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2022","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Autumn","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPKYOTO","tags":[{"name":"east_soasia","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Feeling in Japan: Culture, Emotion, and Brain","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"317":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGKYOT","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"101K","course_id":220638,"description":"Goal is to express thoughts and opinions in paragraph length in spoken and written forms.

Quite simply, Darwin and Wallace needed the access to the tropics that opened up with the Age of Discovery in order to recognize the mechanisms of evolution. Class sessions will alternate between discussions and lectures. However, rather than modern primary literature or textbooks, the readings will come from three classic texts: Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle (1839), Henry Walter Bates' The Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863), and Alfred Russel Wallace's Malay Archipelago (1869). These three books cover much of the geography of the Iberian colonies founded in the Age of Discovery: respectively, Spanish South America and the Portuguese Amazon and Southeast Asia. No matter what &quot;mid-19th century popular science\/travelogue&quot; might suggest, these books are highly readable and show how insights sprang from individuals who confronted a newly available world with rigorous curiosity. (And they also highlight how much the tropics have changed and how oblivious people can be to the consequences of their actions.) The lectures will then bring up to date the science that developed from the explorations described in the texts. And Spain is the perfect location for a local focus to demonstrate the enormity of the geologic forces involved in what can otherwise feel like biogeographic abstractions. Imagine contact of North Africa and Iberia sealing off the Mediterranean, allowing it to dry down to brine in a hole more than 3 km deep and imagine Gibraltar being carved by its catastrophic reflooding, it all happened more than once and can be expected surely to happen again.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPMADRD","tags":[],"title":"New Worlds and Old: The biogeography of the Age of Discovery as the foundation for later insights in","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"373":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGMADR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"102M","course_id":208113,"description":"Advanced.

Blake was also a critic of capitalist modernity writing in an age of industrialization and urbanization, political revolution, religious doubt and doomsdayism, scientific breakthroughs in fields like chemistry and biology, the making of feminism, the birth of animal rights, agitation for the abolition of slavery, challenges to class hierarchy, and the commodification of life. Students will gain familiarity with Blake's illuminated poetry, including The Songs of Innocence and Experience; The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; The Book of Thel; Visions of the Daughters of Albion; The Book of Urizen; America a Prophecy; and Europe a Prophecy. We'll visit places important to the development of these artworks in London, including St. Paul's Cathedral and the Royal Academy of Arts. We'll also have a private tour of Blake's work in the Tate Britain.

We will apply range of scholarly approaches to these works and their lives on film and in the theatre, including close reading, performance studies, critical race studies, queer studies, and gender studies. Students will be introduced to these methodological frameworks early in the course, and are free to apply any of them in their assignments. Throughout our exploration of these canonical works, we will consider how today's theatre and film makers, as well as their audiences, engage with these plays to make new meanings and interventions in contemporary culture. Central to our discussion will be an interrogation of the place of Shakespeare in contemporary British culture, chiefly through analysis of performances of his plays and those of his contemporaries in major national institutions: Shakespeare's Globe, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC, and the mainstream film industry. At the same time, however, we will be equally concerned with how marginalised groups, including minority ethnic and queer artists, have turned to Shakespeare's plays in order to reposition his works, and themselves, on the global and political stage. These in-class discussions, supported by study-group preparation, will prepare students for the written assignments, which are designed to allow students to interpret these plays and their theatrical\/filmic afterlives, with a particular focus on the social and political implications of staging and screening these plays in today's diverse British society. Each week, students will be expected to have read the set text (a play by either Shakespeare or his contemporaries) and, in one of three 'study groups,' to have engaged with a critical or interpretative response to that text based on assigned reading or viewing (usually a scholarly reading, or a film or theatrical adaptation).","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"taps","organization":"OSP"}],"title":"Shakespeare and Performance","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"401":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"code":"61","course_id":223281,"description":"What is it like to start your own company?

This course will focus on the confluence of these two communities by exploring the art of migration from the 20th century to today&iquest;including painting, sculpture, drawing, street art, photography and video--with a focus on works representing France, or produced in France or by French artists.Beyond aesthetic considerations, many of the artists who formed part of the successive generations of the legendary 20th century &quot;School of Paris&quot;, and continue to enrich the Parisian art scene today, have also come fleeing various forms of persecution or turmoil in their home countries, from war to anti-Semitism to fascism to colonialism to terrorism.  The ways that these &quot;cultural migrants&quot; have represented their journey and negotiated their multi-layered identities in their work, both then and now, will be explored.  Current day migration in a post-colonial context will also be studied, as a means to discover the various strategies used by contemporary artists to humanize and give visibility to the struggle of the displaced, while addressing societal concerns fueling displacement today, including racial, social, religious and gender inequality, conflict, and climate change.Instructional format will include in-class lectures, discussions with contemporary artists, and above all, site visits to Parisian museums, neighborhoods and relevant socio-cultural institutions.  Students will be evaluated through in-class participation and attendance, an in-class presentation on an assigned artwork, and a research paper on a topic relevant to the course scope.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[],"title":"Art and migration in France: picturing displacement and the displaced","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"465":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"10A","course_id":210355,"description":"For Paris Program students with academic experience in electronics, telecommunications or signal and image processing.

We will examine foundational works while considering their engagement with the historical and political contexts in which they were produced, conveying the changing aspects of Parisian social landscape in the broader Francophone cultures of Paris (e.g. examining the dialogue with Francophone artists from Sub-Saharan Africa).

We will analyse recent initiatives in the realm of commemorative events of the colonial past and its legacy, specifically of diverse controversies facing contemporary French and North African societies today.

The motivations, goals, and inspirations of both renowned and emerging practitioners in Paris and beyond will be studied to place street art in a wider art historical and activist context.  Throughout the course, the paradoxical notions surrounding contemporary street art will be considered: revolt versus appropriation, urban degradation versus beautification and even speculation, delinquency versus activism, anonymity versus stardom, street versus screen. Forms of instruction will include in-class discussions and debates, student presentations, guest lectures by street artists and other cultural actors, site visits to community and cultural institutions and city walks to explore the writing on the walls in diverse Parisian neighborhoods.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34653,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":1,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 7, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"audrey","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"calefas-strebelle","middle_name":"","name":"calefas-strebelle, a.","sunet_id":"acalefas"},{"first_name":"Amanda","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Herold","middle_name":"Gerard","name":"Herold, A.","sunet_id":"agherold"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 3, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[],"title":"The Writing on the Walls: Street Art in Paris, yesterday and today","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"498":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"50M","course_id":212687,"description":"Topics include: the relationship between atomic structure and macroscopic properties of man-made and natural materials; mechanical and thermodynamic behavior of surgical implants including alloys, ceramics, and polymers; and materials selection for biotechnology applications such as contact lenses, artificial joints, and cardiovascular stents.

Each class session will focus on a television program, news broadcast, documentary or fiction film. Industry professionals working in television and film will be invited to class to share their expertise and interact with students. With more than 373 movie theaters located throughout 20 arrondissements, Paris, is truly the world capital of Cinema. Approximately a hundred theaters are considered independent movie houses, some of which are classified as historical monuments. This unique situation will allow students to learn about the origins of cinema and the importance of film to French culture during class field trips. The professor will provide technical guidance about news reporting and film production in general and how to make a short documentary. As a final project each student will create a personal 2-3 minute short film using their smart phone about a theme relating to their time in Paris.

The objective of this course is to better understand the food system of a large citysuch as Paris, with a focus on the underlying human-environment interactions. Part I of the course will focus on food production in the peri-urban areas of Paris and other regions in France. 70% of the food consumed in Paris comes from France. We will start with von Thunen's model of the central state.We will also discuss the rise of urban agriculture, with a field visit of an urban agriculture site under the municipality's &quot;Parisculteurs&quot;program. Part II will focus on food distribution and consumption in the city. We will discuss concepts such as agglomeration economies and supply chains. We will conduct interviews atan open-air market in Paris where &laquo;mara&icirc;chers&raquo; bring in their own production to sell. Part III will focus on recent trends to increase the sustainability of food production in France. We will discuss emerging social norms related to sustainable food and how they interact with agricultural and environmental policies in France and the European Union. This will include the rise of organic agriculture, geographical indications, various public and private eco-labeling initiatives, and attitudes toward genetically-modified crops in France.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19464,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Eric","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Lambin","middle_name":"Francois B.","name":"Lambin, E.","sunet_id":"elambin"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 9, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"},{"name":"envirsuselect","organization":"URBANST"},{"name":"eenr","organization":"IR"}],"title":"FOOD CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"506":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"67","course_id":222943,"description":"The following topics areproposed for an independent study: (1)Land use history in France:After centuries of deforestation, French landscapes have been reforesting for more than a century.

Eighteenth-century writers, scientists, and aristocrats sought to burnish Paris's reputation as the capital of modern thought and worldly sophistication, from which Enlightenment radiated. Visitors eagerly sought admittance to the famous salons, attended the theater, and watched public scientific displays. But by the end of the century, the novelty promised by the French philosophes took on a revolutionary dimension. Now the streets of Paris provided the stage for some of the most momentous historical events in Europe, from the storming of the Bastille to the execution of Louis XVI. And the ramifications of this revolution echoed throughout the nineteenth century, both in Paris and beyond.In this course, you will study the cultural and political history of Paris using the city itself as a classroom. Whenever possible, you will explore the role of salons, scientific academies, museums, and coffee shops by both studying and visiting them in person. You will examine the sites of revolutionary events and consider how they are commemorated (or not).

These stories are far from being mere fairy tales; they unveil the violence of the Early Modern period while revealing the horrors of social and domestic violence. This course has two goals: the first one is to present the nature, extent and causes of domestic, social, and every day violence in absolute and &quot;despotic&quot; regimes of the early modern times. The second one is to &quot;read&quot; violence and the emotions linked to it in popular tale narratives. Our repertoire will include French translations, adaptations, and mise en oeuvre of the 1001 Nights (from Arab and Indo-Persian traditions), 1001 Days (from Turkish traditions), as well as popular French tales, such as Les Contes de Perrault, and the philosophical and political tales of Rousseau, Diderot, and Voltaire. Our approach will be comparative, psychoanalytic, feminist, cross-cultural, sociological, and anthropological. Class will be taught in English; French originals will be available for French speaking students. An additional section in French will also be available for French speaking students.

We saw this during the COVID-19 pandemic, when an urgent need arose to disseminate science-based health messages to the public. Because levels of education and literacy vary, didactic and overly technical media messages often miss the audiences that need them the most. Adolescents and young adults are often among the hardest to reach with effective public health messages. At the same time, these audiences are the highest consumers of short video content via social media, presenting an interesting opportunity for public health educators.This course examines various approaches to increasing the reach and effectiveness of digital communication media for global dissemination. We will examine existing evidence-based frameworks including human-centered design, the use of narratives, entertainment-education and how we can apply the principles of universal design for learning to our efforts to engage a broad, global audience.We will also explore novel use cases for animated video interventions in global settings and innovative research methods for evaluating the effectiveness of digital health content, using large, online randomized controlled experiments. This innovative approach to measuring impact emerged out of necessity during the pandemic but is likely here to stay.Students will be exposed to the theory, science and creative process needed to create and test engaging digital communication media. In small groups, students will apply this knowledge to the creation of their own public-facing media message on a topic of interest, integrating new technical skills with art and communication.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34157,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 7, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Maya","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Adam","middle_name":"","name":"Adam, M.","sunet_id":"madam"},{"first_name":"Rosina","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Miller","middle_name":"S","name":"Miller, R.","sunet_id":"romiller"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 3, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Spring","units":"4"}],"subject":"SINY","tags":[],"title":"Design for Extreme Scalability: An Introduction to Global Communication and Media Innovation","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2022-2023"},"630":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGNYC","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"121","course_id":222453,"description":"In this immersive intensive, students will learn the basics from professionals in the fields of Acting, Directing, Theatrical Management, Union Representation and Stage Management.

The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class. Issues of resilience will be discussed in relation to major disasters including floods, extreme storms and climate change. The 7 global resilience targets will be identified according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The major components of resilience will be reviewed in class followed by a visit to or by a representative from the 100 Resilient City Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Superstorm Sandy in 2012 will be used as a case study to identify the disaster impact to the urban environment in NYC. We will discuss the emergency response of the City after Sandy and assess the performance of the NYC resilience plan. We will explore how New York City is preparing to respond and recover from future major disasters as part of the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. n nNovel technologies will be discussed in terms of their implications for disaster resilience and sustainability.

How do art, activism and racial justice connect in performances aimed at changing ideas?  How do major arts institutions address questions of equity and difference? We will discuss how art can function as a form of aesthetic knowledge in the service of justice.  In doing so, we will grapple with the role of the creative arts in mitigating social change and study artists who have sought to intervene in the restrictive covenants of racial, gender and other segregationist or national orders.

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline.

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society?

For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training.

We will focus on the political, economic and technological forces that have shaped the writing and rhetoric of journalists. Students might explore debates such as fake news, bias and objectivity; partisanship and polarization; or polling and political coverage. We start by writing an analytical essay about multimedia reporting, move into writing about research regarding a topic of your choice, and close by sharing research in oral presentations. At each step, we work together as a group, doing workshops, engaging in discussion, and collaborating in peer review.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story. Students in this course will have a special opportunity to meet personally with poet Billy Collins and singer Aimee Mann when they visit campus in April. Does not fulfill NSC requirement.

In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent.

Students will learn how to read a case, scrutinize court briefings, and contextualize bias as a foundation to erect a more just, equitable, and inclusionary legal system.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":18355,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":4,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":5,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 7, 2023","end_time":"4:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Harriett","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Jernigan","middle_name":"Virginia-Ann","name":"Jernigan, H.","sunet_id":"harriett"},{"first_name":"Kathleen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tarr","middle_name":"A.","name":"Tarr, K.","sunet_id":"ktarr"}],"location":"160-321","start_date":"Apr 3, 2023","start_time":"3:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2022-2023 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: Racism, Misogyny, and the Law (CSRE 194KTA, FEMGEN 194, HISTORY 261C)","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2022-2023"},"979":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"194MF","course_id":218176,"description":"Every day a new headline alerts us to the lack of race and gender diversity in the tech sector in Silicon Valley. At the same time, science and technology are often lauded as objective systems capable of producing color- and gender-blind truths and social good for all of us. This course pushes beyond the headlines and the hashtags to think about the complex relationship between gender, race and science. Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced.

But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
