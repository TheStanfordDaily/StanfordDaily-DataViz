220 examines public policies for dealing with problems arising in markets in which competitive forces are weak. The focus is on monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and other environments where market mechanisms are unlikely to produce outcomes that benefit consumers more than the alternatives involving costly government intervention. The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provides consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and\/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as:  telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases.  The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

To this end, the course will provide an introduction to: (1) accrual accounting concepts, principles and conventions; (2) the process of preparing and presenting the primary financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows); (3) the judgment involved and discretion allowed in making accounting choices; (4) the effects of accounting discretion on the quality of the (reported) financial information; and (5) the fundamentals of financial statement analysis. Class time will be allocated to a combination of short lectures and discussions of the assigned cases. The assigned cases are based on actual corporate financial statements and\/or &quot;real life&quot; financial situations.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation, attendance, written assignments, final paper.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mandatory P\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"}],"class_id":29552,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":45,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Nov 21, 2014","end_time":"3:45:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Francis","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Stanton","middle_name":"","name":"Stanton, F.","sunet_id":"vstanton"}],"location":"LAW 95","start_date":"Sep 22, 2014","start_time":"2:15:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2014-2015 Autumn","units":"3"}],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"professionalskills","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Accounting","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2014-2015"},"17":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"227","course_id":126619,"description":"Theories of political economy that explain policy choices and behavior in energy markets in the U.S. and overseas.

The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art-and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded? We anticipate having two or three visitors to the class during the quarter, such as a gallery owner, auctioneer, and museum director. In addition, we will also have the students participate in at least one or two interactive negotiation simulation exercises inspired by real situations and controversies in the art world.

Effective advocates and counselors provide innovative and thoughtful solutions to complex problems. But there often isn't enough attention devoted in law school either to thinking creatively or to reflecting in a creative way on the issues students confront inside and outside the classroom. This course will respond to this gap by building a bridge between law and the arts, with the goal of helping students hone their ability to think creatively and use disciplined imagination.  Law &amp; Creativity will meet twice a week and have dual components designed to inform one another. The first session will be structured as a seminar in which students gather to examine and discuss creative treatments of legal and professional issues in a variety of media (including film, fiction, and nonfiction). The second session will follow the creative-writing workshop model in which students submit their own fiction and creative nonfiction pieces for group discussion. Through the workshop process, students will develop the skills necessary to constructively critique and workshop one another's work, and learn a variety of techniques for improving their own creative writing.

This course expounds on the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, and seminar discussions -- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process.  Students will explore these issues in a weekly 3-hour seminar and then discuss application to their particular Rule of Law Project countries in weekly hour long workshops. This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; and least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.  A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic. - - Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.

This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.

In the clinic, students develop legal advice, learn to review and write contracts and governance materials, meet with client executives, examine commercial relationships, and receive extensive feedback about their work. No prior experience in business, finance, or corporate law is necessary.  Students work on structural, programmatic, contractual, affiliation, and governance matters for corporate entities. Students typically represent multiple clients during the term, interact with client CEOs, CFOs, board members, and general counsels, and work in teams with other students and the instructors. Students receive detailed comments about the design, content, and execution of work-products and client communications, and about their performance in client meetings and calls. Students regularly assess their own work throughout the quarter and prepare a self-evaluation at the end of the term.  O&amp;T clients are all established Northern California nonprofit corporations. Most of the clients generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $25 million, and some are considerably larger. We focus on these organizations because they are corporations that typically have substantial governance and external disclosure obligations, active boards of directors, audited financial statements, complex programs, varied collaborations, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the clinic's contact is a senior executive. We think they provide excellent material for students learning about organizational representation and institutional corporate practice.  The course includes a seminar that generally meets twice a week. Seminar meetings focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management.  Evaluation and grading are based on detailed points of emphasis that reflect ways of working we believe characterize an effective lawyer and responsible colleague. Course design and operation reflect the instructors' combined 40+ years of corporate practice representing consumer products, finance, technology, and life science companies, in both law firm and senior in-house roles.  Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website.

In the clinic, students develop legal advice, learn to review and write contracts and governance materials, meet with client executives, examine commercial relationships, and receive extensive feedback about their work. No prior experience in business, finance, or corporate law is necessary.  Students work on structural, programmatic, contractual, affiliation, and governance matters for corporate entities. Students typically represent multiple clients during the term, interact with client CEOs, CFOs, board members, and general counsels, and work in teams with other students and the instructors. Students receive detailed comments about the design, content, and execution of work-products and client communications, and about their performance in client meetings and calls. Students regularly assess their own work throughout the quarter and prepare a self-evaluation at the end of the term.  O&amp;T clients are all established Northern California nonprofit corporations. Most of the clients generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $25 million, and some are considerably larger. We focus on these organizations because they are corporations that typically have substantial governance and external disclosure obligations, active boards of directors, audited financial statements, complex programs, varied collaborations, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the clinic's contact is a senior executive. We think they provide excellent material for students learning about organizational representation and institutional corporate practice.  The course includes a seminar that generally meets twice a week. Seminar meetings focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management.  Evaluation and grading are based on detailed points of emphasis that reflect ways of working we believe characterize an effective lawyer and responsible colleague. Course design and operation reflect the instructors' combined 40+ years of corporate practice representing consumer products, finance, technology, and life science companies, in both law firm and senior in-house roles.  Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: The syllabus includes specific expectations and criteria relating to methodical analysis, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and crisp execution, applicable across client and seminar work.

In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured &quot;public law&quot; litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity. In addition to examining these distinctive problem areas, we will look at broader, cross-cutting institutional reform proposals that have received recent attention.  Students in Section (01) will write three ten-page writing exercises on topics discussed in class.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), and have the option to write a final independent research paper for Research credit, with instructor consent.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.  This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship. This course complements Constitutional Litigation (Law 641), and students, especially those who plan to clerk, will benefit from taking both courses.  In-School: Three hour exam.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the &quot;final cut&quot; and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations.  The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

Since the establishment by the Security Council of the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia twenty years ago, the field has experienced remarkable growth. The international community has created a range of new international criminal tribunals to investigate and prosecute international crimes. National courts are now also exercising an expanded domestic and universal criminal jurisdiction over international or transnational crimes. The substantive criminal law has also expanded, and notions of individual responsibility for international crimes have evolved and extend the reach of international criminal law.  At the same time, new debates have emerged about the suitability of using criminal justice mechanisms to respond to mass atrocity situations. nnThis course will explore legal and institutional responses to transnational and international crime.  It will examine traditional forms of international cooperation to address transnational crimes and the concept of universal jurisdiction that provides a basis for treating certain crimes as &quot;international.&quot;  It will cover the range of institutions created to punish international criminals, including the Nuremburg and Tokyo tribunals, the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the &quot;mixed&quot; international\/domestic tribunals such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Cambodia war crimes tribunal, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. As these tribunals approach the end of their mandates, the International Criminal Court is assuming greater importance. The progress of the ICC will be considered and, so too, the role of the United States in all of these developments. Alternative institutional arrangements and options for responding to international crimes, such as truth commissions and amnesties will also be examined. nnThe course will also include: (1) the moral and political goals that motivate responses to international crimes; (2) the role of international politics and foreign policy considerations in shaping responses to international crimes; (3) the suitability of different institutional models for addressing international crimes. nnThe grade for this course will be based on a final research paper of 26 pages, double spaced. The topic should relate to a subject covered directly or indirectly by the syllabus or readings.nnElements used in grading:  Class participation and final paper.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"International Criminal Law","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2014-2015"},"97":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"335","course_id":209692,"description":"A survey of the major legal and ethical issues presented in the practice of law.

It begins with a review of a corporate acquisition agreement, the document at the center of a friendly transaction. We then consider a variety of explanations for how corporate acquisitions may promise to create value, and think about why they often fail to meet that expectation.

The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants).

Modern technological, economic and business forces are placing extreme pressure on the traditional private attorney law firm model.  These forces will transform, eliminate or replace virtually every aspect of legal services provided by attorneys.  Traditional foundations of the large law firm model such as &quot;billable&quot; hours, summer associate programs, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries) and high associate-to-partner ratios are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era.  Today, the business need for clients to select a one-stop, full-service law firm for their important legal work has, in a variety of circumstances, disappeared.  Sophisticated clients are utilizing a wide range of legal services firms and companies for their legal work.  As a result, the diversity of legal business models and manner of providing legal services has greatly expanded.  Often individual lawyers (or very small firms) can provide high-level legal services by assembling &quot;virtual&quot; teams in which each team member handles a different constituent part of the representation.  &quot;In-sourcing,&quot; &quot;out-sourcing&quot; and the transferring of large portions of work to non-lawyer legal support vendors are all becoming fixtures of the legal economy.  This rapid increase in diversity on both the supply and demand side of the legal economy will greatly alter the skills and prerequisites required for the successful private practice of law.  The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined.  In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.  Part two of the course will additionally focus on how specific skills such as project management, social networking and information management will be crucial to a successful legal career.  Part two of the course will also discuss how the changing legal environment creates new ethical and professional challenges for attorneys.

Students will have the option to take the seminar alone or to combine it with a practicum.  This seminar component  will explore three primary issues: 1) the Supreme Court's forty-year effort to define what cases can permissibly receive the death penalty and the procedures under which it must be imposed; 2) the arguments for and against the death penalty, with a major focus on whether the death penalty deters, is administered in a racially biased way, or is otherwise implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and 3) what the U.S. and international status of the death penalty is today and what the prospects are for the future.  The readings on deterrence and racial discrimination will entail some substantial statistical analysis, although a background in statistics, though helpful, will not be required.

Students who take the practicum component must attend the 9 seminar class meetings and  do all reading and writing assignments of the seminar except that instead of writing a final paper of their choosing they will focus on actual policy or litigation work that will be arranged with various death penalty abolition groups.

The legal specifics of corporate formation, tax, and contracts are well covered by a variety of other courses at the Law School and will only be reviewed briefly in this course. Instead, the course will examine the life stages (formation, financing, execution, and exit) of a venture-backed company from the entrepreneur's perspective. Students who are interested in either starting companies or working with startup founders as their legal counsel will solidify their foundations in this course. There will be no textbook - course materials will include PowerPoint slides, readings from various entrepreneur and venture capital blogs, sample business plans, and other sources.  Grades will be based on class participation (10%), short reflection papers and\/or short problem sets (15%), and a 60 minute oral business plan presentation with accompanying slide deck and written business plan.  This course is limited to 16 students with students who have taken VC I receiving priority in enrollment.  Prerequisites: A modest background in financial analysis or Excel, such as might be obtained in QM finance (Law 467), is a prerequisite for this course.  Venture Capital I will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and e-mail the Consent Application Form available on the SLS Registrar's Office website (see Registration and Selection of Classes for Stanford Law Students) to the instructors.

Research Track projects are to be supervised by two or more professors, at least one of whom must be a member of the Law School faculty. At least one faculty member in addition to the supervisors must read the written product of the research, and the student must defend the written work orally before the readers.

Students will take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with the prosecutor, drafting and arguing motions, and trying cases before judges and juries.

While students will have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all trial work will be closely supervised.  In addition to casework, there will be weekly workshop sessions.

The goal of the clinic is to train students how to try a criminal case from beginning to end while engaging in thoughtful reflection on the role of the criminal defense attorney in the criminal justice system. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.

In this practicum students will work collaboratively to build a new online dispute resolution (ODR) system to be piloted in the San Mateo Superior Court for Family Law.  Stanford students will work side by side with faculty, court staff, and experts from Modria Inc. (a leading mediation software designer) to implement the Beta Test of the design.  The core of this quarter's work will focus on introducing the platform to its first users - claimants with family law disputes - and designing an evaluation program for collecting feedback and implementing improvements.  The project will include opportunities to learn basic coding skills, innovate user experience (UX) design for a tech product, and work directly in family law client services.  Most importantly, this project addresses a long-neglected access-to-justice issue in California, where 60-80% of claimants arriving in civil courts cannot afford an attorney.  ODR, designed and tested properly, may streamline the system for those who need it most while still offering supervision and quality control of the court staff.

That market faces a stark dichotomy. Solar energy's prospects as a meaningful electricity source are increasingly bright. Yet, amid a global glut of solar panels, the future contours of the industry - the relative roles of leading players such as the United States and China - are increasingly unclear. Students in this seminar will analyze industry and policy data to assess China's competitive strengths in the global solar industry and, based on those conclusions, to suggest finance and policy approaches that the US and China each could adopt so that the two countries operate more strategically in an economically efficient global solar market - and, by extension, a globalizing market for cleaner sources of energy. This research will figure into a project on this theme underway at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. Course deliverables will vary among students and will be based on discussions at the start of the class between the instructors and the students. Some students will produce papers; others will develop and analyze key sets of data. Students from graduate programs around the university - the law school and others - are encouraged to apply. Preference will be given to those with demonstrated interest in energy finance and policy, particularly bearing on China, and with fluency in Mandarin, though neither is a firm requirement. Given that the Steyer-Taylor Center project will continue through the academic year, preference also will be given to students who intend to continue with the practicum in both the winter and spring quarters.  Students have the option to write papers for W or R credit. If the paper involves independent research, then it will be eligible for R credit.

Manuel Cavarrubius (California Superior Court, County of Ventura) and members of the California Judicial Council to increase access to justice for limited English proficient (LEP) court users. The project interacts with the process of the Joint Working Group for California's Language Access Plan and assists development of a response to a U.S. Department of Justice notice that certain Court policies and procedures may be inconsistent with Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations. Numerous state and local laws are also implicated by a potential lack of access for LEP court users. The California Commission on Access to Justice estimates that well over 7 million Californians, almost 20% of our state's population, &quot;cannot access the courts without significant language assistance, cannot understand pleadings, forms or other legal documents and cannot participate meaningfully in court proceedings.&quot; Through fieldwork, literature review, legal research, and interviews with relevant participants and stakeholders students will identify challenges facing LEP litigants.  Students will interview and consult with such parties as the Chief Justice, appellate court judges, state bar leaders and other attorneys, members of the Language Access Task Force of California, and individual stakeholders to develop recommendations for potential reform options, including whether the use of such technologies as video remote interpreting (VRI) can expand access to justice for LEP litigants.  Students will be asked to produce written materials (findings and recommendations) as well as make oral presentations to California judges, Judicial Council staff, and others at meetings at each quarter. This policy practicum will be offered Fall 2014 and Winter 2015.  We encourage students to participate both quarters if they are able to do so.  Students should also note that field work will require some number of students to engage in overnight travel for court observation and local interviews in areas outside the Bay Area.  Your availability to take the practicum both quarters and to travel for field research should be noted in your consent form.  Students have the option to write papers for PW or R credit. If the paper involves independent research, then it will be eligible for R credit. The instructor and student must agree whether the student will receive an R or a PW. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from the PW writing section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  The practicum must be taken for at least two-units or more to receive R or PW credit.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.

The most noteworthy examples to date involve pay-for-success schemes to reduce recidivism in the UK, Massachusetts, and New York City prisons.  Santa Clara County will soon issue a request for proposals for a social impact bond to reduce the hospitalization of mentally ill patients at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.

It is likely that with climate change, the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in some areas over the 21st century, and that the return interval of flood events will decrease, greatly increasing overall flood risk. Traditionally, flood mitigation has occurred through the use of hard engineering - seawalls, revetments and levees. However, natural habitats and ecosystems also offer significant, and often overlooked and undervalued protections in mitigating or buffering flood hazards. Hazard mitigation plans and conservation project plans very rarely explicitly recognize the protective value of natural habitats, even though this value has been well documented. Moreover, hazard mitigation agents and environmental conservation organizations seldom work together, although recent catastrophic events highlight why it would make sense to do so.  FEMA Region IX and The Nature Conservancy in California have recognized this and wish to develop a paradigm for working together to promote nature-based flood mitigation, and have asked for our help. Students in this practicum will: (a) Identify a coastal community with areas of both high flood risk and conservation value; (b) Design a nature-based strategy for risk reduction, which could include managed retreat and\/or other mitigation\/adaption tactics; (c) Identify available resources\/programs\/incentives for and barriers to implementation at the local, state and federal levels; (d) Design a process for enabling the community to avail themselves of these resources; and (e) Comment on how laws, regulations and programs could be changed to better facilitate nature-based flood risk reduction.  Students will also provide insight into the transferability of this approach beyond the study area.  Elements Used in Grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.

Law and medicine have been struggling to find ways to strike a balance between what the patients might want (or say they want), and what makes medical, economic, and ethical sense.  People have been encouraged to fill out &quot;Advanced Health Care Directives,&quot; which give guidance to doctors and surrogates (usually a family member) on what to do when faced with end-of-life dilemmas.  Another form, adopted in just over half the states (including California) is the POLST form (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment).  The two types are supposed to complement each other, but they are different in important ways.  The Advanced Health Care Directive expresses what a person wants, or thinks she wants, and\/or appoints a surrogate, in case the patient is unable to express her wishes.  Anybody can fill out a Directive, at any time of life.  Ideally, a copy goes to the surrogate, if one is appointed, and another to the primary care physician.  The POLST form is meant for people who are seriously ill.  It is a one page form, printed on bright pink paper.  It is signed by patient and doctor.  The directives (for example &quot;no artificial nutrition by tube&quot;) are supposed to be controlling; the patient, of course, can change her mind; but there is no surrogate.  It is an agreement between the patient and the doctor.  Who uses these forms?  How effective are they?  To what extent and in what situations are they useful?  In what situations are they not useful?  Can they be made more useful and, if so, how?  There has been research on the subject; and a major report on the end-of-life issue (originally due out in December) will be released this summer.  The class will look at some of this literature, but the main point will be to find out what local hospitals and nursing homes are doing.  Students will conduct interviews with doctors, nurses, and other health care specialists in order to find out what one might call the living law of the Directive and of Polst.  The aim is to get a more realistic picture of the situation in the area:  how are these forms used, when are they used, what has the experience of health care professionals been; perhaps also some insight into the experience of patients and family members.  The ultimately goal would, one hopes, be policy recommendations for improvements in the forms themselves, and the laws relating to the forms, along with  recommendations for ways to improve the way the forms are or can be used; or whether some entirely different approach to the problem might be needed.  Stanford Hospital and Clinics will be the client in researching and addressing the above questions.  Elements used in grading:  Final Paper.  NOTE:  Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee.  Such approval will be granted only for good cause shown.  Even in the case of a successful petition for additional units, a student cannot receive a letter grade for more than eight units of independent research (Policy Lab practicum, Directed Research, Senior Thesis, and\/or Research Track).

The resulting publication aims to assist strategic litigators, social change actors and rights activists in understanding the promise, risks and complexity of the burgeoning global practice of strategic litigation and in wielding this specialized justice tool more skillfully. The autumn practicum will culminate in a conference at the Law School in December 2014 before an international audience of practitioners, with the possibility of student papers appearing in a conference compilation.  Students who are available both autumn and winter quarter may continue their work on the project through the winter.  The project on the impacts of strategic litigation will examine how legal judgments - both positive and negative - and the ensuing record of implementation have influenced, together with other tools of change, the advancement of human rights in a variety of settings. Over the course of the Practicum, students will explore one or more of the following human rights themes: equal access to quality education, the death penalty, disability, housing rights, land rights and\/or state-sponsored violence\/torture. Cases will be drawn from domestic courts across the globe, as well as regional human rights tribunals and UN treaty bodies.  Specific questions to be examined include: What contributions to social, political and legal change has strategic litigation made on particular issues in particular places? What were the conditions, circumstances and manner in which litigation was pursued (in conjunction with other tools) which enhanced its contribution(s), and which diminished them? What does comparative experience teach about the risks and trade-offs involved in deciding whether, when and how to litigate so that it generates the strongest and most enduring impacts?

This strategy is based on a set of recommendations generated by an interagency review of the U.S. government's capabilities mandated by Presidential Study Directive 10 (PSD-10) of 2011. In unveiling this major new initiative, President Obama underscored that Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States. Foundational to the PSD-10 recommendations was the creation of a high-level interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (APB) to monitor at-risk countries and emerging threats in order to coordinate the U.S. government's responses thereto. Since being established in 2012, the APB has worked to amass and strengthen a range of legal, diplomatic, military, and financial tools for atrocity prevention.  This policy lab would support the APB primarily through one of its constitutive entities, the Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ) in the U.S. Department of State. GCJ is headed by an Ambassador-at-Large (Assistant Secretary equivalent) and advises the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights on U.S. policy addressed to the prevention of, responses to, and accountability for mass atrocities. Students enrolled in the lab will pursue a range of projects devoted to (a) strengthening existing tools (such as hybrid accountability mechanisms and commissions of inquiry), (b) developing new capabilities (such as a global atrocities prevention sanctions regime), (c) evaluating the efficacy of past efforts in order to glean lessons learned, and (d) gathering best practices from other states and entities engaged in similar endeavors, all with an eye toward developing concrete recommendations for future action. The client is the Office of Global Criminal Justice in the State Department. Students may have the opportunity to travel to Washington to meet with the client and other government agencies involved in the APB and to present preliminary findings for feedback and additional direction.  This is designed as a two quarter policy lab, although students may enroll for a single quarter (WINTER OR SPRING).

The California prison system remains under federal court control for unconstitutional overcrowding, and the federal court is loath to terminate the injunction without some reassurance of reforms that might prevent the overcrowding from recurring. In the absence of a state sentencing commission, the Chief Justice believes that we at Stanford  can perform a fresh new analysis of the parts of the Penal Code that most merit review, in terms of their undue complexity, their arguably disproportionate  severity, and the possibility that they are major drivers of the size of the prison population. Enhancements are an incredibly complex part of the Penal Code. Tens of provisions, many of them obscure even to judges, allow for very large upgrades to sentences  because of aspects of conduct that are said to aggravate the underlying crime. (Please note that while some of the enhancements under review involve prior crimes,  we are not dealing with the Three Strikes Law.)  The Chief Justice's administrative arm,  the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), acknowledges  that no one has performed even a statutory analysis  of the overall scheme of  enhancements, much less any empirical effort to connect them to prison inputs. This will likely be a multi-term Policy Lab that will ultimately gather data to attempt this  empirical analysis, but the first term effort is more circumscribed. A team of students will undertake the mapping of the statutory terrain - a charting of all the enhancements in the Penal Code and the many cross-permutations of these enhancements and the crimes to which they attach, and as a first empirical cut, identification of the permutations of crime and enhancements that are most often charged in California.

Many of the agencies operating in the energy and environmental sphere have overlapping jurisdictions, but they also have different missions, priorities, and resources that push them toward agency-specific policies and programs and away from cross-cutting, government-wide initiatives. The result has been sub-optimal federal implementation of clean energy solutions, responses to climate change, the coordination of regulatory and permitting activity, and the like. In this SPRING QUARTER policy lab (3 units), students will work with the  Center for American Progress (CAP) and the Office of Management &amp; Budget in Washington to scope out the governance challenge and to review and analyze administrative tools (e.g., Executive Orders; Presidential Memoranda; inter-agency Task Forces; budget-led initiatives, etc.) that have been used to address it. Students will develop candid assessments of successes and failures and seek to identify common ingredients that may help predict the efficacy of cross-agency efforts.

Many of its decisions (both adjudicatory decisions and regulations) are of enormous importance to the California economy.  The proceedings to adopt these decisions are often lengthy and complex.  The CPUC is interested in working with the Stanford Law and Policy Lab to consider procedural reforms to promote transparency and efficiency in its decisionmaking.  There are three areas of potential procedural reform that the Policy Lab might consider.  Which of the areas are selected for study will be decided after discussion between the CPUC, the supervising professor, and students enrolled in the practicum.  i) Ex parte communication rules.  Ex parte communications between outsiders and PUC  decisionmakers are prohibited in adjudicatory cases; permitted in ratemaking cases but must be disclosed; and permitted in rulemaking without disclosure.  Some CPUC decisionmakers believe that ex parte communications are essential to enable them to properly consider different points of view and to facilitate timely decisionmaking.  Others view such communications as inherently unreliable and as undermining the transparency and accountability of the agency.  The CPUC is interested in studying this problem and considering amendments to relevant statutes and regulations.  ii) Open Meetings law.  The Bagley Keene Act requires the CPUC to conduct open meetings when a quorum of its 5 commissioners meet.  Bagley Keene has, in practice, effectively prevented the CPUC from properly managing its operations and engaging in useful deliberation.  The CPUC and the Little Hoover Commission are considering whether to seek an amendment to Bagley Keene in order to permit more coordination and collaboration among CPUC Commissioners.  iii) Evidence rules.  The &quot;residuum rule&quot; requires that on judicial review of an agency decision, the record must contain at least some evidence, other than hearsay, to support the agency's findings and conclusions.  A recent court decision has said the CPUC is subject to the residuum rule because it has been declared CPUC policy.  A variety of evidence (such as studies by other government agencies) often comprise the underpinning of CPUC decisions and may not come under any hearsay exception.  As a result, the residuum rule could compromise the efficiency of CPUC proceedings and risk reversal of future decisions on technical evidentiary grounds.  The CPUC is interested in investigating potential solutions for remedying this problem.  This practicum will carry two units of credit.  It will be supervised by Visiting Professor Michael Asimow.  Students will be expected to do field work and legal research and write a paper that makes policy proposals in one or more of the three areas discussed above.  Enrollment is limited to three students and will be graded under the H\/P\/R\/F system.  Grades will be based on the level of a student's participation and the quality of the final paper.

Students will request workforce demographic data from the 62 prosecutors offices in CA (58 county District Attorney offices and 4 US Attorney offices) based on the California Public Records Act and the federal Freedom of Information Act, collate and analyze the collected data, and collaborate in drafting a public report describing and analyzing the results.

California began its effort to address prison overcrowding in 2011 by enacting sweeping legislation to &quot;realign&quot; criminal justice resources and shift major responsibilities from the state level to local counties. In 2012, voters passed the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (Proposition 36) by ballot measure, reforming the California's famously harsh recidivist sentencing statute. And this past November, voters extended the reforms by passing the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act of 2014 (Proposition 47), reducing several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors. Past Project students were closely involved in enacting last two reforms and are now engaged in implementing the new sentencing statutes.  In addition to studying the law and related criminal justice policy, students will assist with different stages of ongoing litigation on behalf of nonviolent inmates seeking sentence reductions. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigation in the field, and draft petitions on our client's behalf. Students will also contribute to ongoing policy work to ensure the effective implementation of reforms impacting our clients, which include individual prisoners and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.  The Project is an ongoing, fast-paced organization that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in the seminar. This course offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law, and to hone practical litigation and advocacy skills in and out of the courtroom. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week. Students will also meet for 1 hour individually and in teams with Project director Mike Romano each week to discuss their work on their projects.  CONSENT APPLICATION: Interested students must apply to enroll in the seminar by sending a one-page statement of interest and resume by email with the subject line &quot;application&quot; to Mike Romano (mromano@stanford.edu). Applications will be considered on a rolling basis. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing Req. for Law Degree-Matric prior Fall 2012","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"WRITING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"}],"class_id":30590,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Writing Req. for Law Degree-Matric prior Fall 2012.

Transactions should be tailored to the goals and circumstances of each set of parties, but there are some general principles that can guide the design process. This seminar examines some of these principles: such as the use of embedded options in contracts, of third parties, and of tailored procedures for dispute resolution and enforcement. Some of the readings and discussion will be at a fairly high level of abstraction, drawing on economic and sociological theories of contracting.  The rest will closer to ground level, looking at particular types of transactions, such as franchising, construction, joint ventures, or start-up financing. We will also look at the process of innovation in contract design, including the role of lawyers and digital document production. Students will be required to write paper for the seminar, and encouraged to focus on a specific type of transaction.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

We will explore and evaluate the common critique that the contemporary structure of various entities (such as schools, courts, andnthe legislature) contributes to increased inequality.  Some of the likely topics to be covered in class, along with their concomitant impact on equity, include: language and identity; trade-offs between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome; stereotype threat; felon disenfranchisement; labor market inequality; urban vs. rural poverty; the erosion of mental health services; and how factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, and income can contribute to academic achievement gaps.  The class will explore the substantive issues related to equality and inequality as well develop written and oral skills for advocacy, including drafting op-eds, position papers, and other written materials and preparing for oral presentations.  Each student will be responsible for leading at least one class at San Quentin State Prison to a mixed class composed of Stanford and San Quentin prisoner students. Students will be also be expected to write weekly reflection papers in response to the assigned reading and to attend and participate heavily in each class discussion; they will also be expected to edit and provide individual feedback on the written assignments of the San Quentin students. In addition, attendance at a one day training conducted by the Prison University Project is mandatory. Class will meet on Fridays from 3:00 - 5:00pm. Grades will be based on a combination of active class participation and preparation, consistent attendance, and several written assignments.

For example, why is cable television so expensive? Why can comedians swear on cable TV, but not on broadcast TV? Should regulators care as much about violence as they do about indecency? Can we trust the market to give the audience what it wants? Will the market provide content that is in the public interest, such as local news or educational programming, or do regulators need to intervene?  Should we care if media outlets are increasingly owned by a few small conglomerates? And how does the Internet affect the need for ownership regulation?

About 60% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. The new Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a free trade agreement currently under negotiation between the EU and the U.S., will further strengthen substantially the economic ties between the EU and the U.S. in the near future. In the past few years, even several proposed mergers between U.S. companies have been killed solely by the EU antitrust authorities, although approved by the U.S. antitrust regulators. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers.  Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts.  Secondly, we will explore the legal framework of doing business in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital and persons, (b) EU competition\/antitrust law, as well as (c) EU e-commerce law. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU.  Additional education and research opportunities for students in EU law, building on this course, can be found in the course syllabus.  Special Instructions: Students have the option to write a research paper in lieu of the response papers (01). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Perhaps as a result, electricity suppliers are among the most heavily regulated of large firms. This regulation is composed of a complex patchwork of overlapping state and federal regulation that is constantly evolving to meet emerging challenges to the energy system. In this course, students will acquire a basic understanding of the law of rate-based regulation of utilities. We will then examine the history of natural gas pipeline regulation in the United States, concluding with the introduction of market competition into US natural gas markets and the advent of shale gas. Next, we will cover the basics of the electricity system, including consumer demand, grid operations, and power plant technologies and economics. We will then revisit cost of service rate regulation as it has been applied in the electricity context. Next we will examine reform of both rate-regulated and wholesale market-based structures, focusing on various attempts to introduce market competition into aspects of the industry and to strengthen incentives for utility investment in energy efficiency. Finally, students will examine various approaches to subsidization of utility scale renewable energy and the growth of distributed energy. Throughout, the course will focus on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing, but ever evolving federal and state roles in regulating the supply of electric power. Students will write two 1000 word response papers to questions related to readings and outside speakers in addition to taking a final exam.

It analyzes each step in the process from perspective of the entity, of the founder-employees, and of the venture backers. It also considers the incentive mechanisms and control structures used at each step of the transaction (and alternatives to these structures), with a focus on both the underlying economic and financial theory, as well as on pragmatic considerations in structuring the transactions.

Because there is a preference for local civil and criminal SEP placements (see Law 474 and Law 475), your SCEP proposal must explain (a) how it meets the goals of the externship program; and (b) why a similar project cannot be accomplished in one of the placements offered in the Bay Area.

course examines what diplomats and scholars once referred to as the &quot;law of nations,&quot; as it has matured and evolved to adapt to today's complex and interdependent world.  We will begin by considering fundamental questions about the nature of international law - the sources of international law (including treaties), the subjects of international law, the origins of international law in the sovereign equality of states, and the absence of mechanisms for the authoritative interpretation or enforcement of international law.  We will explore core international law concepts and issues such as state responsibility and the bases upon which states may exercise jurisdiction.  We will then examine the operation of international law in the U.S. legal system.  In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of international law topics and issues, including some of particular interest today, such as mechanisms for the settlement of international disputes, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and the emergence of a body of international criminal law and international criminal tribunals for its enforcement.  Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena and the extent to which international law actually affects the behavior of states.  This course provides a general grounding in public international law and a foundation for more advanced or specialized international law courses.

This transformation will not happen automatically. Technical, legal and economic choices will affect whether the Internet can realize its potential or not. Communications law - the law that governs both the physical infrastructures for communications services such as cable and telephone networks as well as the communication services which are provided over these infrastructures - has become one of the most important arenas in which choices affecting the future of the information society are made. The debates over network neutrality (whether network providers should be able to restrict the applications and content that their Internet service customers can access over the network) or the right ways to foster broadband deployment are examples of this trend.  At the same time, the Internet's ability to support a variety of different communications services such as telephony, information services or video over the same physical network infrastructure challenges the existing communications law, which is based on the assumption that different physical infrastructures offer different communications services.  What are the features of the Internet that are at the core of its economic, social, cultural and political potential? What can regulators and legislators do to allow the Internet to realize this potential? And how can they allow applications like Internet telephony and traditional telephony to coexist without giving one an unfair advantage over the other? The course will address how current law deals with these questions, but also explore what regulators and legislators may do to better deal with the challenges posed by the Internet. The course is mostly focused on the US, but highlights developments elsewhere where appropriate.  Special Instructions: Students may take Communications Law: Internet and Telephony and Communications Law: Broadcast and Cable Television in any order (neither is a prerequisite for the other).

It offers a space and time for each student to consider his or her own personal and professional direction through the course materials, class interactions, and a series of reflection papers.

The more recent and still active movements include such as Law and Moral Philosophy, Law and Economics, Critical Legal Studies, Feminist Jurisprudence, Public Choice Theory, and Neo-formalism. The readings are drawn primarily from primary materials - the important contemporary manifestos and critiques of the schools of thought studied, along with writings that involve their application or reveal their influence. Among the recurring issues treated are: How political is law? How objective? How much do and should courts legislate? Is law mostly rules? Principles? Policies? Decisions?

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the businesses and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Berkeley).  Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements.  The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations.  In addition to the regular Monday class, classes will meet for the live negotiations on two Thursday evenings on-campus at 7:00 PM (10\/16 and 10\/30) and three Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM (10\/11, 10\/25 and 11\/15) in the San Francisco office of DLA Piper (555 Mission Street; close to Montgomery St. BART station). Due to the Thursday and Saturday classes, this class will conclude on November 17.  The course will be limited by lottery to eight (8) law students (additional students from engineering or business may also participate).  Attention Non-Law Students:  You must complete and submit a Non-Law Student Course Add Request Form to the Law School Registrar's Office (Room 100).  See Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration on the SLS Registrar's Office website.  Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 615) or comparable prior experience is recommended.  A primer on basic negotiations skills will be offered at a time TBD as an alternative for students who have not had a prior negotiations class or experience.

This introductory course will examine the historical precedents and philosophical reasons for treating juveniles differently from adults, and review empirical evidence about child development that can illuminate the reasons for their special status within the court system. Students will learn about the distribution of juvenile delinquency and the impact of significant social and institutional influences on delinquency: family, school, peers, and drugs.  The course will also provide a detailed overview of the juvenile system, from its beginning to the current state of the institution, which will include a review of police work with juveniles, pretrial procedures, and the juvenile court and corrections systems. Major court rulings that have shaped contemporary juvenile justice will be presented. Finally, the course will consider dispositional options available to Courts, and will identify the most effective in reducing delinquency. By the conclusion of this course, students should have an understanding of the juvenile justice system and how it compares with the adult justice system, what programs work to reduce recidivism, and be cognizant of some of the major legal and policy issues confronting that system today.  The course format will combine lecture, group discussions, and guest presentations. Students may also have the opportunity to observe the juvenile justice system first hand by attending a juvenile court session, visiting a correctional facility for adjudicated delinquents, and hearing directly from those who work with high-risk youth on probation or in the community.

We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.

In this course, we will study who personal injury lawyers are, how they find clients, how they fund litigation, and how they usher complex cases to conclusion.  In so doing, we will address:  the role and regulation of lawyers, the use and abuse of the contingency fee, the legality and normative consequences of solicitation and attorney advertising, the propriety of secret settlements, the rise and impact of &quot;alternative litigation finance,&quot; and the difficult ethical and practical issues posed by class actions, aggregate actions, and multidistrict litigations (MDLs).  The final segment of the course will involve a series of case studies, where students will have the opportunity to see the course's themes echoed and expressed in recent real-world controversies.

Topics include intelligence-gathering, investigations, and the prosecution of suspects in U.S. courts, including controversies surrounding the use of informants, material support laws, racial and religious profiling, electronic surveillance, terrorist watchlists, and terrorism trials. In exploring these controversies, the course focuses on several core themes: 1) the contested relationship between rights and security; 2) the question of institutional choice in national security decision-making and oversight; and 3) the challenge of assessing the efficacy of counterterrorism measures. The course pays special attention to the policy controversies that affect U.S. communities, including minority and immigrant communities.  To develop skills central to the work of practicing lawyers, students will write two short papers that simulate the actual work assignments of lawyers for government agencies, human rights groups, or other interested parties. For instance, students might draft a local ordinance on police intelligence-gathering, prepare a memo for a national security agency head or member of Congress, or design an administrative mechanism for resolving watchlist complaints. These assignments, for Writing (W) or Professional Writing (PW) credit, will be due before the end of the quarter. Alternatively, students may opt to take the seminar for Research (R) credit with the professor's approval, according to the standard requirements and deadlines. In addition to completing the writing assignments, students are expected to read thoroughly and contribute to a thoughtful and lively discussion each class.

Using a broad mix of case law, case studies, and scholarly analysis, this seminar will interrogate those attacks-including their historical roots, their theoretical justifications, and their practical effects.  We will first study &quot;replacement reforms&quot;-attempts to jettison the common law in favor of alternative compensation mechanisms, including workers' compensation, auto no-fault, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, housed within the U.S. Court of Claims.  Second, we will study modern tort reform initiatives, often dubbed &quot;discouragement reforms,&quot; which have chiseled away at damages and chilled personal injury victims' incentives and capacity to seek relief.  Finally, we will study the United States Supreme Court's own tort reform activity, including recent jurisprudence limiting punitive damages and granting broad preemptive effect to agency actions. Through this analysis, students will develop a deeper and richer understanding of the tort system, its contemporary operation and excesses, and the uneasy but important place tort law-and civil litigation more generally-occupies in contemporary American society.

We will approach the material as an exercise in advanced constitutional law, exploring how courts have used--or might use--federal or state constitutional provisions to address issues regarding a wide array of issues involving sexuality. The core of the class will relate to contemporary controversies concerning sexual orientation and gender identity (including, for example, regulation of sexual conduct, defining sexual identity, the Boy Scouts' policy, marriage and parenting rights of same-sex couples, among others). But we will also discuss other issues, including controversies about sex education and polygamy.

It is an area that combines elements of treaty and customary international law, public policy, and private dispute resolution. In the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties and other agreements with investment-related provisions, followed by a sharp rise in the number of disputes between private investors and sovereign states under those specialized legal regimes. In particular, investment arbitration under the auspices of the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is booming, with some 419 arbitration and conciliation proceedings instituted under the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules as of 31 December 2012.  Due to the widespread geographical participation of states and private investors in investment arbitration, involving significant amounts of money in every conceivable investment sector-from oil, gas &amp; mining, construction, transportation to the financial sector-the particularities and dynamics of investment treaty law and arbitration are becoming increasingly important to foreign investors, sovereign states, and the global economy that is increasingly fueled by foreign investment.  The rise of international investment law and arbitration has also bred a new and exciting practice area in global law firms, where teams of lawyers act on behalf of investors against sovereign states, or defending sovereign states against investor claims, before international arbitral tribunals.  This course will cover four broad areas: (I) the historic, theoretical and policy grounds underpinning international investment law; (II) the substantive obligations and standards governing the investor-state relationship; (III) the growth of investor-state arbitration and its impact on international law; and (IV) the wider issues of fairness and functionality of investment treaty law and investor-state dispute resolution.  The course uses materials from international investment treaty texts, case law, and commentaries to enable students to evaluate and apply legal doctrine to future situations.  As international investment law and investment arbitration is a dynamic, unsettled, and controversial body of law, this course will highlight different and sometimes conflicting interpretations and decisions in the area, and invite students to analyze, discuss, and form their own views on key issues.

Next we briefly touch on some aspects of U.S. administrative law that are essential to understanding the material that follows (students should feel free to take this class without having taken Administrative Law). This is followed by a discussion of the risk assessment and cost-benefit frameworks essential to understanding the current U.S. approach to environmental problems. We conclude this segment with a comparison of two approaches to chemical safety regulation - the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act and the EU REACH directive.  Next, we focus on three key substantive federal environmental statutes: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Next, we turn to the National Environmental Policy Act to understand how environmental concerns are included in the process of making agency decisions.

Students will try a full jury case through to verdict with use of jurors and before a real judge in the Superior Court in Palo Alto at the end of the course. Students will also have a chance to watch the jurors deliberate and talk with them after their verdict. The course takes place during seven weeks of the Autumn Quarter with two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 (these usually occur on T, W, or Th, plus an occasional M), plus two Saturday workshops and the final weekend of jury trials, Saturday and Sunday November 15 and 16. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end before 9:00. For a detailed schedule, contact Stephanie Basso at sbasso@law.stanford.edu.  The format for each topic begins with a lecture\/discussion featuring video vignettes of various techniques and a live demonstration by an expert trial lawyer. Following the discussion portion of each topic are small group sessions during which each student practices the skills involved. Constructive feedback is given after each exercise by two of our faculty of very experienced Bay Area litigators and judges. Most exercises are also videoed for further one-on-one critique by another faculty member. The course ends with full jury trials.  The central philosophy of the workshop is that skills are best acquired in an experiential manner by seeing and doing. Frequent short, well-defined exercises followed by immediate constructive feedback in a non-competitive, non-threatening atmosphere provide the core of the program. The workshop directors are Tim Hallahan, Sallie Kim and Jeff Kobrick. Tim has taught similar programs at Harvard Law School, the University of San Francisco School of Law, Boalt Hall, the California Continuing Education of the Bar, and in private and public interest law firms around the country. Sallie is a partner in a civil litigation firm and taught a class at SLS previously and served as Associate Dean for Student Affairs previously. Jeff  is a partner in a civil litigation firm and has taught practical litigation skills courses at Harvard and Stanford Law Schools for a number of years.  Special Instructions: If you haven't taken Evidence you must contact Mr. Hallahan before the course begins for some brief pre-course reading assignments. There are no papers or tests, but attendance at every session is required.  Since we will begin our trial advocacy exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only.  Mandatory attendance.

You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your secretary, and all of their  counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself.  This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory, you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system.  The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because  participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required.  Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Once you commit to the class, you must complete it or receive a failing grade. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Petitions of this type must be extraordinarily strong in order to be granted.

We will consider the role of lawyers and the legal system in advancing reforms; different career paths of public interest lawyers; ethical issues related to working as a lawyer within a social movement; the personal impacts of this type of career choice; and strategies employed by lawyering in differing settings, from issue-based non-profits to government agencies, and private public interest law firms or legal services groups. Readings will include law review articles, legal pleadings and case studies that allow analysis and exploration of the tensions and challenges that exist within the legal system for public interest practitioners. Students will also be exposed to practical skills outside of litigation that social justice lawyers should understand.  Students will be asked to produce several short papers throughout the quarter. For an additional credit and Research credit, students will be asked to produce a substantially longer paper on a related topic and can be excused from some of the shorter assignments. Students taking the seminar for Research credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.

They formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and advocate before the court at evidentiary motions or preliminary hearings.  The cases, almost always felonies, include drug offenses, thefts, burglaries, assaults, weapons possession, and a range of less common crimes.  Police witnesses are most common, though students sometimes offer testimony from crime victims.  When defendants testify or offer other witnesses, they face cross-examination by clinic students.  Students spend at least three full days a week in the D.A.'s office.  All six students must spend all day on Tuesdays and Wednesdays on site.  Each student also must choose a third on-site day, when the student will work closely with the student's on-site supervisor.  The six students need not all choose the same third day, but each student must pick a day that stays constant through the term.  There generally will be two class sessions each week-a three-hour on-campus class and a lunchtime seminar in the D.A.'s office. At the beginning of the term classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, and argument. Toward the end of the term the focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice. Topics include the impact of race, gender, and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers.  Students typically tour the Santa Clara County jail and crime lab, San Quentin Prison, and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along.  Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system.  Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings.  During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor.  Evidence is a prerequisite.  In rare cases a concurrent clinic module in evidence can fulfill this requirement.  Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged.  Class attendance is mandatory, and class participation will be considered in grading.  Students will be asked to commit to the course in the summer of 2014; dropping the course after committing will not be permitted.  Students will earn twelve credits.  The clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period.  Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from on-site and faculty supervisors.  Students are expected to be available by email or cell phone during workday hours Monday through Friday.  Students are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work.  In some weeks casework may demand longer hours.  Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework.  Grading is on the H\/P system.  Please also refer to special instructions for the general structure of clinical courses.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.

Sentencing is the process by which criminal sanctions are imposed in individual cases following criminal convictions. Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable.  The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with  close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore sentencing theories and their application, the nature, scope and function of corrections, the impact of mass incarceration on crime and communities, the effectiveness of rehabilitation, the relationship between sanctions and crime, and the consequences of prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates.  Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. We also plan to visit a correctional facility. This course is open to ILs, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings. During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and participate in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work.  The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies.  Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers.  Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary.  No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings. During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and participate in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work.  The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies.  Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers.  Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary.  No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence. Thus, while the context of the course is litigation, the objectives are much broader than the mastery of litigation technique.  This course is not open to first year Law School students. Priority will be given to those students who commit to taking the class if given consent to enroll. Please indicate your commitment on the consent form.

Students learn in class and apply in practice the laws affecting religious liberty, whether statutory or constitutional, and counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity.  Students can expect to handle a discrete accommodation project-e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the practice of his or her faith-and participate in a longer-term project involving the exercise of religion-e.g., represent a church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves administrative, trial, and appellate work-though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

In mediation, the parties to the dispute, who may be represented by lawyers, are in charge of the outcome. With the assistance of a mediator they may be able to reach agreements at any stage in a dispute, in some cases avoiding litigation altogether, in other cases agreeing when the case is on appeal. This course will introduce you to the theory and practice of mediation. You will learn about the mediation process primarily by experiencing it in roleplay and hands-on exercises. The course also includes readings and discussions, brief lectures, demonstrations, student presentations, and videotapes. You will mediate disputes based on actual cases, and be coached in small groups by Bay Area mediators. The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend four or five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

We will review such statutes as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Rehabilitation Act (Sec. 504), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Fair Housing Act Amendments, California Developmental Services (&quot;Lanterman&quot;) Act and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The course examines disability from a civil and human rights perspective and has a &quot;cross-disability&quot; orientation insofar as it addresses the legal interests of persons with mobility and communication impairments, as well as intellectual and psycho-social disabilities.  Exploration of the legal doctrine will be complemented with practical skills exercises and presentations by guest speakers.

This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, and negotiating on behalf of stakeholder organizations to solve complex problems. We will study negotiations and stakeholder dialogue processes involving a diverse set of public and private actors.  In the context of both real and simulated case studies, we will address diverse public policy issues, both domestic (including civil rights, racial justice, economic inequality and natural resources management) and international (negotiating bilateral and multilateral agreements, including global security environmental treaties). The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations.  Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a substantial group paper and presentation analyzing a selected case (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue) and the team's internal negotiation process. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 615) or its substantial equivalent.  Advanced degree students (and graduate students in other departments and programs) are encouraged to enroll provided that they have previous negotiation training or equivalent practice experience.

In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, farm animals, animals in entertainment, and federal issues regarding animals.  The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to animals in new ways.  Students have called it a great bar review class, because concepts from many areas of law are covered with respect to their application to animals and their interests.  More and more firms, large and small, are providing pro bono (and paying) work in the animal law area, as the field gains momentum and reputability in the legal community.  Mr. Wagman is a partner at Schiff Hardin in San Francisco, with a full-time animal law practice, representing organizations and individuals in a wide range of cases.  He is one of the authors of the Animal Law casebook, and has been practicing animal law for most of his 23-year career.  His practice includes litigation, consultation, legislative work, and extensive writing and lecturing on various animal law topics.  The class includes regular updates on his current cases, as well as real-life experiences from the front lines of the animal law frontier.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various tactical, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach focuses on the following questions: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? Among the conceptual issues we will examine include the problem of spoilers who seek to sabotage agreements, the role of mediators, the role international legal rules can play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, and the advantages and disadvantages of unilateral versus and reciprocal measures in advancing conflict resolution efforts. Particular conflicts we will explore include the Northern Ireland conflict, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the U.S.-Soviet Cold War rivalry.nnSpecial Instructions: Total enrollment in this course will be limited to 20.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.  Special Instructions: - - General Structure of Clinical Courses.  The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation, written assignments. For clinic: professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking and commitment.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.  Special Instructions: - - General Structure of Clinical Courses.  The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze and prepare for negotiations, and (2) to expand their skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations.  Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, a series of short papers and in-class presentation.

In addition, the clinic may pursue a specific policy research and advocacy project that will result in a written policy brief and policy proposal.  Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation.  Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education.

Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education.  The education clinic includes two or three mandatory training sessions to be held at the beginning of the term, a weekly seminar that focuses on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a one hour weekly meeting with the clinic instructor. Admission is by consent of instructor.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. - - Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. - - Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. - - The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. - - Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career. - - The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. - - For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. - - Cross listed with the School of Education.  - - Elements used in grading: Projects and class participation.  Writing (W) credit is for students entering prior to Autumn 2012.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them.  As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals.  Students will be responsible for submitting a reflection paper (three-to-five pages each) after each week of the course. Each memo will be due by the Friday of the following week.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on the papers submitted, with the instructor retaining the right to take class participation into account. Attendance is mandatory and students must seek instructor approval for any absences not due to illness.  This course is offered to foreign graduate students. It is taught on an accelerated basis over the course of three weeks between September 2, 2014 and September 19, 2014. Thus, the course meets on average nine hours per week.

The first general question is whether philosophical inquiries on big issues - e.g. what it means to be well-off; what obligations do we have to strangers who are radically worse off than we are; when should we observe rights-based limits on our pursuit of aggregate welfare; what does it mean to coerce another party - help us make choices when it is not obvious what we should do. The second, related question is whether empirical knowledge - e.g. psychological, economic - might help us, in addition, instead, or no more than philosophical insight. The specific questions we will focus on have little in common, other than that they are not easily answered. Some refer to decisions that seem wholly self-regarding, others that seem to refer to obligations to others. Some involve acting in professional role, some out of role. Some seem plainly important, others might seem more trivial. And it is possible, of course, that you will come to believe that philosophers or empiricists may have more to say about some of the issues that we discuss than others.  The five questions I tentatively plan on exploring are: (a) how a late adolescent patient (or a doctor advising that patient) ought to choose between an operation that will significantly improve various aspects of her life over the next thirty years but poses a substantial risk of leaving her wheelchair-dependent in middle age and an operation that will lead to impaired functioning for the next few decades but mobile without mechanical aids past the age of 50 (b) how we can evaluate claims that virtually all of us living in economically prosperous countries are obliged to give away a substantial chunk of our income to save the lives of very poor people around the world (c) how we should evaluate the propriety of torture designed to elicit information about planned criminal\/terrorist activities that might arguably save those who would be harmed if the plans came to fruition (d) how an attorney in a big law firm ought to determine when and whether it is appropriate to ask an administrative assistant to do work that is not directly related to the production of legal services (e.g. pick up laundry from the cleaners) and whether (and if so, why) the answer to that question is sensitive to the gender of the attorney and the attorney's administrative assistant, and finally, (e) whether existing rules governing the conduct of war that draw significant distinctions between killing soldiers and killing civilians and between killing civilians intentionally rather than knowingly are sensible.

From Tony Soprano to Saddam Hussein to Bernie Madoff, we are all familiar with individuals who have made crime and violence a constant in their lives. There are far more people, though, who try generally to live good lives, but find themselves having acted or having failed to act in ways that are widely condemned as evil.  Over the course of our five meetings, we will be looking (through some books, reports and films) at case studies of such circumstances, ranging from clergy and others in authority who covered up evidence of sexual abuse, prosecutors who ignored evidence of wrongful convictions, lawyers who turned blind eyes to client misconduct, and soldiers who committed acts they would have once found unimaginable. We will also look at a contrasting case study of individuals who resisted great pressure and kept their moral compasses well-calibrated. Throughout our inquiry, we will reflect in particular on the power of institutions and authority in affecting ethical mores.  Begin in Winter Quarter and run through Spring Quarter.

For this year, we have changed the name--and the emphasis to a degree.  As in the past, we will discuss books that address the phenomenon of people having great confidence in their beliefs or opinions, even when there is a reasonable possibility that they are wrong. For example, many arguments about politics or policy involve highly complex factual assumptions and predictions. Despite the difficulty of assessing the validity of factual assumptions and forecasting the consequences of any particular decision, many people maintain great confidence in the correctness of their beliefs. Why is that?  In addition, some people are very successful in influencing other people with respect to such beliefs or opinions.  How do they do that, and what makes their audience susceptible to being convinced? In the extreme, what allows this sort of person to be a leader or at least a &quot;thought leader&quot; (to use what regrettably seems to be a new entry into our lexicon)?  In this discussion group, we will read books that engage these questions in diverse ways.  Students that join the group will be expected to be full participants in the discussion.  Neither of us is an expert in the topic and neither of us expects to have any more to say than you will. So please join us only if you find this format appealing.  Another requirement of the group will be to create a written log, or summary, of what we read and discuss.  We will all share responsibility for writing this.

In client counseling and transactional representation, we are charged with helping our clients avoid failure. And as professionals, we are enjoined to avoid failures ourselves. So we spend our careers in and around failure - anticipating it, reconstructing it, and seeking to prevent and remedy it. This seminar explores the human experience of failure in both legal and non-legal settings. What are the circumstances (structural and cognitive) that appear to lead to personal, professional, legal, political, and moral failures? How does the law shape social understandings of what failure is? What kinds of failures appear to support the belief that failure is (almost always) avoidable, and thus the fault of individuals who experience failure? Why do other failures seem inevitable? What is the narrative structure and allure of representations of failure as a condition of success? How are failure and the harms that flow from the experience of failure remembered or forgotten by individuals and groups who cause failure and those who attempt to redress it? Sources for the seminar will range from cases dealing with professional malpractice and cultural histories of professional ideology to poetry, constitutional history, theories of creative destruction, and responses to mass atrocities.

In early 21st century, the main socialist countries have disappeared and globalization has produced a pronounced convergence between common law and civil law. We also became aware that comparative law has to compare more than law and has to include the social and political context of the law. The comparative method is important, but the substance to be compared has changed.  This course introduces students to the main historical experiences of law using the comparative method and law and society materials. They will find a new way of looking at Roman, medieval, or 19th century law because its &quot;monuments&quot; are placed in social perspective. The method will be used to reconstruct the contemporary ideas of human rights and rule of law in the context of specific countries.  Students will have two writing obligations: (1) brief reflective essays on assigned readings and (2) a research paper. Starting in session 2, students will prepare brief reflective essays on the required reading (or readings) for the session and submit them to the professors and other students 24 hours prior to the beginning of the session. Assigned readings will all be in English. Additional readings may be in other languages. For the research paper the student will, with professorial approval, choose a country and a topic and discuss the work in progress with the professors at least twice during the quarter. It should not exceed 5.000 words.  Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

This course covers the development of alternative dispute resolution in the U.S., with an emphasis on arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). It describes how the federal and state governments have gradually come to accept and now favor the private settlement of commercial disputes based on consent of parties. It examines the many different contexts and industries in which arbitration is conducted, including government-mandated programs for labor disputes, systems established by specific industries such as the diamond trade and professional sports associations, the construction industry, and commercial disputes in general; more controversial is the use of arbitration for consumer, class action and employment disputes. This historic reversal of power over adjudication from government to the private sector has alleviated the delays and uncertainties of judicial litigation, and has created a huge and growing legal field of attorneys, arbitrators, and service providers fashioning and administering systems ranging in complexity from the most formal mega dispute with full discovery to the resolution of mini disputes through mechanically applied algorithms. Allowing private parties to agree on the law and procedures that govern their disputes has led, moreover, to numerous clashes of interests, including evasion of public policies established by legislation. How to deal with alleged violations of public policy, errors of law, erroneous findings of fact, unfair procedures, unequal negotiating power, and arbitrator bias are among the continuing and complex difficulties currently faced by courts and legislatures. The US Supreme Court's recent attempts to deal with several aspects of these difficulties will be considered. We will also examine the less heralded but highly significant use of mediation as a relatively speedy and inexpensive method for private dispute resolution, and the recent development of hybrid systems and other innovations.

Environmental Law &amp; Policy Colloquium offers LLM students the opportunity to discuss cutting-edge legal topics related to, among others, the environment, natural resources management, or energy policy.  The colloquium meets in all three quarters. During the autumn quarter, students will engage in group policy discussions. During the winter quarter, a leading expert in the field - a faculty member, a lawyer, a public official, a member of an advocacy groups, or an entrepreneur - will present his or her research, a paper, or his or her experiences to the class on a specific topic. Following these presentations, all students will participate with the lecturer in a class discussion based on assigned readings, the presentation, and students' own experience in the area. During the spring quarter, the students will present their research papers focused on the solution of an environmental or energy issue.  Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. During the first quarter, students will work in teams and will have to submit memos in preparation for the policy discussion. During the second quarter, students will individually write weekly commentary papers to be submitted before the lecture evaluating, critiquing, and\/or discussing key issues from the assigned reading(s). In the third quarter, students are expected to present their papers and comment on the other students' research.

Usually the term applies to analyses of quantitative data and the researcher relies on data collected by others. But the term &quot;empirical&quot; properly encompasses both qualitative and quantitative data, including interviews, legal documents, survey research and experimental results. Analysts interested in using such data need to understand how they were collected, in order to decide what data can appropriately be used to answer different kinds of questions. Often to answer the questions of interest, a researcher needs to collect new data, which poses challenging questions about how to design an empirical research study. Answering these questions appropriately is important to ensure publication in a peer reviewed journal, which are becoming increasingly important to legal academia.  This seminar will introduce students to the wide range of research methods that can be used to answer empirical questions, provide a framework for choosing among methods, and explain how to use the methods. The project for the quarter is to design an empirical research study on a topic of your choice.  Special Instructions: JD students can take the class for 3-4 units. SPILS students must take this class for 4 units. Students taking the course for 4 units must attend the additional session on Thursday, which is option for others.

A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. The relationship between ethics and culture, global risks (poverty, cyber-terrorism, climate change...), leadership, and the law and policy will inform discussion. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. A broad range of international case studies might include: Ebola; Facebook's mood manipulation research and teen suicides from social media bullying; Google's European &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; and China policy and driverless cars; Space X (Elon Musk's voyages to Mars); ISIS' interaction with international NGOs; sexual assault on US University campuses and in the US military; the ethics of corporate social responsibility (through companies such as Loreal, Whole Foods and Wal-mart); immigration reform; corporate and financial sector scandals; and non-profit sector ethics challenges.

This class offers an overview of how technology is used in legal today's legal practice and how it will be changing the landscape of the legal profession and the law more broadly in the foreseeable future. Through this class students gain an understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities the legal system and the legal industry are facing and learn about innovative new systems seeking to address them. Students will be introduced to technologies that are commonly used for legal research, as well matter management and client management by law firms as well as in-house departments. Students will also be familiarized with the next generation of innovative systems and platforms that challenge the way law has been practiced to date, but also promise to increase the efficiency of our legal system.  The class modules include: (i) Legal Document Management (including electronic legal research, e-discovery, specialized legal databases), (ii) Legal Infrastructure (including: case management, legal lead generation, managing the firms legal business process and legal process outsourcing), and (iii) Computational Law (including: legal expert systems, computable contracts, and unauthorized practice of law issues).  Expert guest-speakers from academia and industry will provide for a diverse and interdisciplinary experience. Successful legal technology entrepreneurs and thought leaders in the legal technology space will provide a practical angle to the discussion.  Special Instructions:  Grades will be based on class participation including class preparation (25% of grade) and one of the following two options:  Option 1 (section 01):  Legal Technology Project (individual or group). Students will be presented with a series of research problems posed by industry partners of CodeX - The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics (http:\/\/codex.stanford.edu).  Students can select a project and, individually or as part of a team, address the posed problem in form of a written report or by preparing a technical demonstration project\/prototype that aims to solve the problem posed by the industry partner (75% of grade); or Option 2 (section 02): independent research paper (75% of grade).  Students shall write an independent research paper on a legal informatics topic. You are invited to propose a topic and a working title and to discuss your topic ideas with us. The topic and the working title of the research paper must be approved by the instructors, before you start your detailed research. Independent research papers require by definition that students include other research materials besides the introductory and advanced readings for class.  Students electing option 2 will receive Research (R) credit.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the length of the research paper.  If you wish to earn 2 units, the research paper shall be at least 18 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins). If you wish to earn 3 units, the research paper shall be at least 26 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins).  Each student can choose one of the above two options, whichever he\/she prefers.  After the term begins, students electing option 2 can transfer from section (01) into section (02), with consent of the instructor. There are no prerequisites for this class.

How &quot;logical&quot; is moral judgment? How do other people's moral choices affect us? Does character matter or is behavior entirely dictated by the situations we find ourselves in?  If it is purely situational, are we morally responsible for anything? How far will we go to convince ourselves that we are good and moral?

How did\/does law work &quot;on the ground&quot; to shape the production of racial hierarchy and creation of racial identities?  In what ways did slavery influence the U.S. Constitution? How has race shaped citizenship in the U.S., and how can we compare it to other constitutional regimes?

Although the U.S. Supreme Court has steadily narrowed the scope for U.S. class actions, other jurisdictions see the procedure as appropriate for resolving securities, antitrust, consumer and personal injury claims.  Some jurisdictions have invited business to resolve trans-national claims against them in their own domestic courts, and plaintiff attorneys who cannot obtain class certification in U.S. courts coordinate non-class mass actions with class action attorneys outside the U.S.  Stanford is collaborating with the University of Windsor (Ontario) and Tilburg University (the Netherlands) law schools to offer a 1-credit seminar on these developments. Using a combination of synchronous and a-synchronous on-line communication, faculty and students at the 3 law schools will describe and analyze differences and similarities among the 3 countries (quite different) class action regimes.  The class will meet weekly (sometimes separately by school and sometimes with faculty and students from the 3 schools together virtually) and SLS students will work with students at the other 2 institutions to research issues that cut across all three jurisdictions.

When, in light of these features, is the recourse to armed force justified?  Pacifists argue that because war is so violent it is never justified, and that there is no such thing as a just war.  Realists, in contrast, argue that war is simply a fact of life and not a proper subject for moral judgment, any more than we would judge an attack by a pack of wolves in moral terms.  In between is just war theory, which claims that some wars, but not all, are morally justified.  We will explore these theories, and will consider how just war theory comports with international law rules governing recourse to force.  We will also explore justice in war, that is, the moral and legal rules governing the conduct of war, such as the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants.  Finally, we will consider how war should be terminated; what should be the nature of justified peace?

Over the past decade, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon.  As these ad hoc institutions wind down, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has become fully functional, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency.  Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria-among others-go unanswered.  This intensive mini-course in the new September Term will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international criminal justice and to the political environment in which it operates. The classroom component (offered at Stanford during the first week of the course) will offer an elemental analysis of international crimes as they have evolved in international law and focus on the challenges of interpreting these norms in a criminal prosecution.  Jurisprudence from the various international tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof.  The course will culminate in a visit to The Hague in the second week of the course, during which time students will meet with principals from the tribunals, including prosecutors, judges, administrators, and members of the defense bar.  In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, and public international law.

The first part of the course will explore barriers to contracting, such as risk and uncertainty, information problems, contract enforceability, and the Latin American legal and economic environments, as well as the tools available to overcome those barriers. The second part of the course will examine how the patterns of corporate ownership and control prevailing in the region shape the style and structure of business deals. Throughout the course, we will apply these concepts to a series of transactions that reflect the changing economic landscape in Latin America.  This course is taught in conjunction with Law 755A.

The course will examine corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore correctional theories and their application, the nature, scope and function of corrections, the impact of mass incarceration on crime and communities, what works in rehabilitation, and how to help offenders reintegrate after a prison term.

What are the benefits and pitfalls of using laws and litigation to achieve public health goals? The course investigates these issues as they operate in a range of specific contexts in public health, including the control and prevention of infectious disease; laws aimed at preventing obesity and associated noncommunicable diseases; tobacco regulation; ensuring access to medical care; reproductive health; lawsuits against tobacco, food, and gun companies; and public health emergencies. In these contexts, we will ask and answer questions such as, what do the Constitution and key statutes permit?  What makes a good public health law?  What does public health evidence tell us about the likely effectiveness of particular legal interventions?  What ethical and economic arguments justify government intervention to shape individuals' and companies' health-related behaviors?

Numerous adjectives have been applied to describe a trend toward austerity -- death, demise, withering, reversal. One writer suggested that the welfare state had not died, it had merely &quot;moved to Asia&quot; along with industrialization. This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigration. We will then turn to the trend toward austerity and retrenchment, and the effect of globalization for the future of the welfare state.  Course Requirements.  Participation\/Discussion (25%). Students are responsible to complete all readings and to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussion. Each student is responsible to lead a portion of the discussion twice per quarter.  Short Reaction Papers (25%). All students must complete 5 reaction papers related to the weekly readings of 2 to 3 pages in length. Reaction papers will include a list of questions to be addressed in that week's discussion. All reaction papers must be posted to coursework in advance of class so that the student(s) leading that week's discussion can incorporate the questions into that week's discussion.  Final Options (50%). Students have the option of completing one final paper of 20 pages in length OR 4 essays of 5 -6 pages each addressing the readings in weeks that the student did NOT complete reaction papers. Topics for 20 page papers must be approved by me in advance, and may be related to a student's dissertation or master's research or may be a stand-alone topic. Papers may take the form of a research proposal and need not contain original empirical research. Shorter papers should engage thoroughly with the literature on the selected topic, and should bring additional sources other than those read for class to bear on the topic of choice.

This seminar will examine digital disruptions to the business models of content creators and industries, and the corresponding impact of the Internet on copyright law, largely through the lens of the litigation involving Google Books. That litigation, which has been active in the courts for almost a decade, is a microcosm of the vast issues that have faced content owners and consumers in the digital age: new technologies to reproduce and distribute works, evolving concepts of fair use, changing consumer norms, massive disruptions to economic interests, increased access to information, concerns about piracy, and threats to competition. We will examine issues related to copyright and content in the digital age by focusing not only on legal claims and defenses, but also litigation strategy, business strategy, policy strategy and public relations strategy, all of which play an important part in the art of lawyering today. The seminar will explore in depth the many contours of the Google Books litigation, including transformative fair use, the problem of orphan works, the rise of ebooks, non-display use and the proposed class action settlement of the case, which was rejected by the district court in 2011. We will also examine digital developments in other content industries (movie, music and newspaper) and focus on two related book issues: the ebook antitrust case against both publishers and Apple and the frequent disputes between publishers and Amazon. The seminar will include visitors who have been involved in the issues being studied. Grading will be based upon weekly reflections, class participation and (for those opting for Research credit) a long paper based on independent research. Some copyright experience is recommended.

To this end, we shall survey Qing law &quot;from the top down&quot; (the perspective of the imperial center, its ideology, and its political imperatives), but also &quot;from the bottom up&quot; (the perspective of quotidian practice at the local level). We shall explore the friction between ideology and practice within the dynasty's formal legal system, but also the field of customary practice that flourished outside the formal system, sometimes in conflict with it.  Readings have been selected to introduce the work of major historians (in English) and to cover a range of basic concepts and problems in this field. One important theme is how scholarly interpretation and debate have changed over time, especially as a result of the opening of Qing legal archives for research. Another theme is the question of what concepts and vocabulary are most appropriate for this field of study. What are the advantages and disadvantages of analyzing the Chinese legal tradition in comparison to the West? Is it possible to understand it &quot;on its own terms&quot;?

As the late William J. Stuntz wrote in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice: &quot;Rule of law has vanished in America's criminal justice system. Prosecutors decide whom to punish; most accused never face a jury; policing is inconsistent; plea bargaining is rampant; and draconian sentencing fills prisons with mostly minority defendants.&quot;  There is no controversy that change is needed, and many believe we are now at a policy turning point. For the first time in nearly 40 years, prison populations are declining and a variety of forces-fiscal, political, and evidentiary-have finally come together to create broad-based support for reconstituting components of the American criminal justice system.  But good intentions are not enough, and a policy opportunity is not the same thing as a policy success. This historic opportunity requires a thoughtfully planned, multidisciplinary effort. This seminar is designed to engage in that effort.  Each student will be asked to select a particular area of potential reform (e.g., police, prisons, prosecution, sentencing, plea bargaining, parole release, risk prediction, juvenile justice, mental health, drug policy, racial disparities, parole), and to offer a comprehensive concrete proposal for change. The final paper will offer a ten-point plan for reconstituting that particular component of the criminal justice system. The concrete proposals must be justified in terms of the pertinent legal and empirical research. The goal of each paper is to provide policymakers with a practical blueprint for choosing a different criminal justice future.  This course is designed for students who wish to delve deeply into specific areas of criminal justice reform, and have an interest in policy reform, empirical research, and advocacy.

The first part of the course will consider alternative accounts of the central problems at the intersection of race and law enforcement, and will explore the roots of distrust between minority communities and law enforcement agencies. The course will examine the social, psychological, historical and institutional roots of these problems.  The second part of the course will survey various reform proposals.  What are the possibilities and limits of civil rights actions? Is reform best undertaken by courts or legislatures? By the federal government or by states? Some reforms focus on prosecutors, e.g. limiting prosecutorial discretion, eliminating grand juries. Other reforms focus on policing, e.g. racial sensitivity or procedural justice training, requiring body cameras, creating more racially representative police forces. To what extent should solutions be pursued through new forms of democratic oversight and accountability (such as police civilian review boards) or through community organizing efforts. Does racially just and effective policing require controlling and constraining the police, or working collaboratively with law enforcement agencies?  This 1 unit course is Mandatory Pass\/Fail, and will meet only three times during the course of the quarter.  Attendance and participation at each class session is required.  Prior to each class session, each student will post questions, observations or reflections that will provide the basis for class discussion.

It will consider the implications these activities have for the region, legal accountability, international peacekeeping and the conduct of American foreign policy. The seminar will include the following segments: 1) the origins and nature of the post-1994 conflicts and recent efforts to resolve them with particular attention to the relationship between modern Congolese history and the Rwandan genocide and the peace-making efforts initiated by the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework agreement of February 2013; 2) accountability for conflict-related crimes committed in the region including sex and gender-based crimes and the legal and other regimes established to address conflict minerals; and 3) the broader implications of the conflict for American foreign policy in Africa, in particular, and in general, and lessons learned about the way in which such policy is formulated; as well as the implications of this conflict for international peace-making and peace-keeping efforts.

Civil rights plaintiffs have difficulty prevailing even when their fact-patterns are sympathetic, as can be seen in contexts from sexual harassment lawsuits to wage to hour claims and from police brutality and prison conditions cases to transnational human rights complaints. Yet when public interest impact litigation does succeed it can enable or even galvanize social movements-both domestic and international-and meaningfully change the legal landscape. This class will focus on the skills necessary to litigate public interest lawsuits, and, in particular, public interest impact litigation. We will focus on marrying research and analysis of statutory text and case law and harnessing the creativity necessary to win such lawsuits by using those research and analytical results to write two briefs from the perspective of public interest or pro-bono advocates. Along the way, we will examine some of the most important briefs of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in various public interest contexts to unpack the rhetorical and analytical skills needed to persuade judges across the ideological spectrum.  Grading will be based on a Mandatory P\/R\/F system, taking into account research and writing as well as class participation.

No prior knowledge of finance will be assumed.  If you want an introduction to corporate finance and won't take the full 3 credit course, this is for you.  The first part of the course (approximately 6 weeks) will consist of on-line modules and problem sets that you will complete on your own and in small groups.  We will cover topics such as: earnings, cash flows, income statements, interest rates, time value of money, estimating firm value, risk and return and the cost of capital.  We will provide a framework for answering questions such as:  how much is this project (or firm) worth?  How should the firm raise money for a new investment?  There will be weekly problem sets and you will get experience with building a simple model (excel spreadsheet) that will help you estimate the value of a potential new project.  The second part of the course will consist of in-class discussions of case studies that apply these valuation principles to particular legal settings:  e.g. valuing settlement offers, merger proposals, appraisal proceedings, and the efficient capital markets hypothesis.  We hope that this flexible format will allow more students to take finance.  If you wish, you can take this course and then later take Corporate Finance 1.  The class will meet 2:15PM to 3:45PM on April 2, May 14, May 21, and May 28. Additional small group meetings will be scheduled with the instructor. On-line component.

After some exploration of the historical origins of antidiscrimination law and its alternative formulations, the course will then turn to the specific contexts in which controversies arise. The settings that will be examined include criminal justice, college admissions, political participation, primary\/secondary education, employment, housing, hate speech, and the formation of family relationships. In each of these settings, we will devote close attention to the role of antidiscrimination law in specific controversies.

But who is in charge of government agencies, and what precisely can those agencies do?  These are the major questions that permeate administrative law, which is the body of legal rules and standards regulating how government is administered.  Accordingly, this course is concerned with the constitutional rules and political pressures that shape agencies; how agencies interpret statutes, promulgate regulations, and adjudicate disputes; the major statutes affecting how agencies work, particularly the Administrative Procedure Act; how the leadership of the executive branch tries to control agency actions; how agencies make judgments about the costs and benefits of regulatory policies; and how courts review agency action.  The course will cover these topics through cases and examples drawn from a variety of areas, including, separation of powers, the constitutional law of due process, environmental policy, health and safety, and national security.  A major theme cutting across these topics is how the law seeks, yet often fails to resolve, tensions between political accountability, scientific and technical rationality, and adjudicatory fairness.

Designing a system for transferring funds is not easy -- as e-firms like PayPal have discovered -- and the law has had to deal with the difficulties of each new system in turn. The principal focus will be on articles 3, 4, 4A, and 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code, with occasional reference to other statutes and to international conventions and treaties.

And often the cry is heard - where are the lawyers? This course explores the evolution of the role of the general counsel in major American public companies and, more broadly, the expanding role of in-house counsel. These are the lawyers in the trenches, on the front lines of American businesses. Each week, we'll review another dimension of the general counsel's job. We'll consider how general counsel today play an important role on the executive team of major companies and explore the different ways in which general counsels manage large corporate legal departments and direct functional legal areas like litigation, IP, corporate and securities, M&amp;A, environmental and employment law. We will also examine the professional responsibilities and legal obligations of the general counsel -- including the delicate and sometimes conflicting reporting relationships to the CEO and the board of directors -- and consider how an in-house legal department fits into a corporation's organizational structure and how it supports the company's operating units on a day-to-day basis. We will explore the general counsel's role in internal investigations, regulatory investigations and compliance programs, and governmental affairs.  We will also consider current practices in how in-house lawyers select, collaborate with and evaluate outside counsel. The class will meet weekly and we will invite current and former general counsels to join us occasionally for our discussions.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them.  As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals.  A written problem will be distributed during each week of the Quarter. During the course of the Quarter, each student is responsible for submitting a series of written memos (three-to-five pages each) analyzing and resolving five of these problems.

This seminar will explore the role of scientific experts in patent infringement litigation.  The class will have a mix of law students and doctoral candidates from the sciences and engineering.  The law students must have some familiarity with United States patent law from classes or work experience.  The graduate students must have completed their required coursework and have TGR status. In other areas of the law where scientific experts are used -- medical malpractice, environmental law, criminal law -- the science itself is often in dispute.  In patent cases, however, the parties generally agree on the science. This affects the relationship between the lawyer and the expert and the substantive content of their interactions. Patent experts need to be able to explain science to the judge and jury, of course.  But they also must help the litigators to choose which legal issues to press and which to concede, and to be aware of how the complications of the science might help, hurt, obscure or reveal how the law should be applied to the facts.  Thus, both the lawyer and the scientist must educate the other about their specialties.nnFor the first several weeks, the class will examine judicial decisions and trial documents involving scientific evidence in patent litigation.  The rest of the quarter is largely devoted to work on the final projects: simulations of expert testimony in a patent case.  Students will work together in teams an will meet regularly with the instructor in order to: select suitable patents; identify a balanced issue on either validity or infringement; prepare claim charts and materials for testimony; and give short, illustrated talks to inform their classmates about their projects.

(Family members are appropriate for only 30% of patients needing these transplants.)  The NBMD is considering whether the procedures that it uses to attract people to enroll as potential donors in the registry could be improved, and also wants to investigate the further possibility that the proportion of potential donors who actually donate cells once it is discovered that they are a match for a particular patient could be increased. Social psychologists here at Stanford are interested in working with the NBMD to examine some of the organization&iquest;s practices, taking advantage of the sorts of social psychological insights often employed by those interested in marketing products or increasing charitable donations. There are questions, of course, about the efficacy of the techniques that they might recommend in terms of increasing ultimate donation levels, but there are also significant questions about whether some of the techniques might run afoul of existing legal regulation or pose other sorts of problems for the organization.  Law students who choose to work on this practicum will almost surely work (in teams with other law students and in conjunction with social psychologists working on this issue and the NBMD) on the following issues: -- To what extent is it consonant with existing medical privacy law (or laws that the NBMD might press to adopt) to reveal personal information about donees to potential donors, assuming that donors are more likely to donate to those with whom they feel a greater personal connection? -- To what degree can NBMD simplify the process of registering potential donors without running afoul of current (or ideal) regulation protecting people against undergoing medical procedures in the absence of informed consent? -- What sorts of material incentives for donation, if any, are permissible under current (or ideal) law and what stance should the NBMD take on the use of material incentives?

Economically disadvantaged students are underrepresented at most selective colleges or universities. This despite the fact that in recent years a number of prominent universities (Stanford among them) have made their financial aid policies considerably more generous for students from lower income families.nRecent research indicates that the pool of resource disadvantaged, high achieving high school students is much larger than commonly thought. Each year, there are more than 25,000 high school seniors from relatively low income families whose standardized test scores and grades place them in the top 4% of high school students, making it likely that they could be admitted to, receive financial aid from, and thrive at a selective institution. Yet many thousands of these talented students do not apply to any top tier college. Some do not even apply to any four year school. nThis failure in the matching of students to schools is socially significant. While higher education has long been a means of promoting mobility for individuals and across generations, the economic benefits of advanced education are even greater now than in past eras. Thus, it has become especially important that universities provide an avenue of advancement for talented students of all backgrounds.nThe Mobility Project is also timely given the likelihood of increasing restrictions on race-based affirmative action. Expanding access to elite colleges for economically disadvantaged students will also contribute to the racial diversity of those institutions. The group of low income, high achievers is more racially diverse (and more specifically, has a higher representation of African Americans and Latinos) than the group of high achieving students from affluent families.nWe will examine a variety of initiatives to increase the enrollment at elite universities of high achieving economically disadvantaged students.

Rivers in the western United States are subject to significant water withdrawals that have had major impacts on the health of their ecosystems.  In an effort to restore the health of such rivers, a number of conservation groups have begun to facilitate voluntary transactions to restore water to the environment, such as acquiring water rights and funding irrigation efficiency improvements.  NFWF has extensive experience with these efforts through its funding of the Columbia Basin Water Transaction Program and implementation of the Walker Basin Restoration Program, and intends to expand its efforts to other parts of the West.  It faces the challenge of deciding where to invest funds and resources in order to achieve the greatest conservation benefits for available dollars.  Students in this policy lab will assist NFWF in the development of an assessment methodology for identifying and analyzing watersheds in the western United States as potential locations for expanding its efforts.

On one hand, closer links between physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers has the potential to reduce cost and improve quality by improving communication across care settings, avoiding wasteful duplication of effort, and reducing medical errors.  On the other hand, consolidation may be used to exploit consumers by facilitating the exercise of health care providers' market power.  This tension has become especially important due to incentives in the Affordable Care Act that encourage doctors and hospitals to join together in Accountable Care Organizations.  This project will examine the following questions:  1)  How can the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission use existing federal antitrust law to allow welfare-improving coordination while prohibiting welfare-reducing consolidation in ways that minimize costs of enforcement, including the legal uncertainty facing providers?  2)  Can adoption of health-care-specific antitrust laws, such as those proposed or enacted in Massachusetts and California, effectively fill in the gaps in existing federal antitrust laws?  3)  What incentives might the federal government provide, through design of reimbursement policies in the Medicare program, to complement federal and state antitrust laws?nConsent Application: To apply for this course, students must complete and e-mail the Consent Application Form available on the SLS Registrar's Office website (see Registration and Selection of Classes for Stanford Law Students) to the instructors.

The price of ivory on black markets has skyrocketed and elephant and rhino populations in Africa are being decimated.  At current poaching rates, African elephants could be wiped out within 8 to 10 years.  Trafficking also is hitting tigers, great apes, sharks and other important species.  The seminar will key into the President's recent Executive Order on this subject (E.O. 13658, issued on July 1, 2013) and related international efforts to reduce the killing in host countries, the transshipment of poached materials, and consumer demand for ivory and other wildlife parts.  The seminar will address US laws and their role in addressing trade in wildlife parts.  It also will undertake a comparative review of the legal structures in relevant African and Asian nations, and the potential role of the international endangered species treaty (CITES) and transnational enforcement efforts in cracking down on ivory and other wildlife-related trafficking.  The seminar will review prior poaching crises, including the elephant\/ivory crisis in the late 1980s, and evaluate why the strategies that reduced killings in the 1990s are no longer successful.  Based on these analyses, the class will develop and submit recommendations for reforms to US, African, and international laws and practices to two groups established under the Executive Order:  (1) the President's Wildlife Trafficking Task Force, which is chaired by the Secretaries of State and Interior and the Attorney General; and (2) the Wildlife Trafficking Advisory Council, which is composed of outside experts who are advising the Task Force.

The General National Congress, elected in 2012, is mandated to form a government, promulgate legislation for Libya's transitional period, and establish a constitution-drafting entity.  A de facto federal structure has emerged since the fall of the Qaddafi regime, and it appears that a federal state structure is the only way forward for Libya.  Even a decentralized framework may be threatened, however, if it does not clearly delineate the powers of the executive heads of provincial territories.  Students in this Practicum will work to support the Public Interest Law and Policy Group PILPG), a pro bono international law firm, which in turn is providing advice to civil society groups in Libya.  To assist PILPG in supporting its clients' engagement on constitutional issues and decentralization, students in this Practicum will develop a legal memorandum analyzing comparative state practice of the distribution of powers between the national executive and provincial level executives in federal or decentralized states.  The memorandum will address approaches states have taken on key issues such as whether the national executive can remove the heads of provincial governments; whether the provincial executive has a role in national-level policies; whether provincial executives maintain any control over the military; and whether the provincial executives' powers can supersede the national executive's powers on certain regional issues.  State practice from the Middle East and North Africa region will be of particular relevance to PILPG's Libyan clients, but state practice examples will ultimately be selected based on their value in explaining or illustrating mechanisms and processes that shed light on the efficacy of different approaches to distributing powers between national and provincial executives.

Many critics from both the right and left are dissatisfied with the way that NEPA and its state analogues are being implemented, prompting some legislators to advocate statutory overrides and agency officials to expand the use of categorical exemptions.  Meanwhile, NEPA proponents are interested in making the environmental review process more user-friendly and efficient, while preserving its core disclosure requirements.  In this policy lab, students will review, analyze, and develop positions on potential NEPA reform options.

The EPA is currently in the process of writing New Source Performance Standards for new and existing coal and natural gas fired electric power plants. A critical question in writing these rules will be the extent to which EPA can allow for economically efficient approaches to cutting emissions. States, including California, industry, and environmental groups are all pushing EPA to incorporate some sort of emissions pricing as either a safe harbor or to propose it as a Federal Implementation Plan that States may choose to join. By doing so, not only will costs fall for regulated sectors but also, deeper cuts in emissions may become feasible. Almost all parties expect, based on prior precedent, that such a proposal will take the form of a cap-and-trade or at least some sort of mass-based cap on emissions.  Adele Morris, the Policy Director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution, has asked for our assistance in formulating and assessing the legal implications of an alternative proposal - a carbon tax. Students will prepare briefings and written comments to EPA and OMB explaining the potential benefits of a carbon tax approach to New Source Performance Standards as well as exploring the legal risks that might be created by this approach. We anticipate that students will also participate in briefings with key OMB and EPA Air and Radiation staff involved in drafting the proposed rule.  The New Source Performance Standard rulemaking for greenhouse gases is the most environmentally and economically significant regulatory effort that EPA will undertake this decade. Partnering with Brookings will allow us to both leverage legal and economic expertise and to inject students into the most exciting environmental policy making currently underway in the United States. Doing so now, before the draft rule is published, allows us to exert maximum influence before the agency loses flexibility to respond to outside input.  To develop skills relevant to the work of practicing lawyers, students will research and write parts of memos and written comments to EPA and OMB on behalf of Morris based on their research into various legal and policy aspects of Clean Air Act Section 111 as applied to the problem of power plant emissions.

Circuit struck down the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet rules. This policy practicum will help policy makers assess the available options in the wake of the court's decision.  In December 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the Open Internet Order, which enacted binding network neutrality rules for the first time. Network neutrality rules limit the ability of Internet service providers to interfere with the applications, content and services on their networks; they allow users to decide how they want to use the Internet without interference from Internet service providers.  In January of this year, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the core provisions of the Open Internet Order - the rules against blocking and discrimination. The decision combined two wins for the FCC with one decisive loss. According to the Court, the FCC has authority to regulate providers of broadband Internet access service under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the FCC's justification for the Open Internet Order is &quot;reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.&quot; The no-blocking and non-discrimination rules, the Court found, however, violate the Communications Act's ban on imposing common carrier obligations on entities like Internet service providers that the FCC has not classified as telecommunications service providers under Title II of the Communications Act.  As a result of this ruling, Internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T or Cox Cable that connect users to the Internet are now free to block any content, service or application they want. They can slow down selected applications, speed up others, or ask application or content providers like Netflix or Spotify to pay fees to reach their users. These practices would fundamentally change how we experience the Internet.  In the wake of the Court's decision, policy makers, stakeholders and observers are debating how to best ensure that the Internet remains open and free. Policy makers essentially have three options: First, the FCC can preserve the Open Internet Rules by reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Second, it can develop a different, narrower network neutrality regime under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act within the boundaries established by the Court of Appeal's decision. Finally, Congress or the FCC can adopt a new network neutrality regime, but only, in the case of the FCC, after reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service. In mid-February, the Federal Communications Commission opened a docket within which to consider how the Commission should proceed.  Special Instructions:  Upon consent of the instructor, students may choose enrollment Option 1 or Option 2:  Option 1 (3 units) - Students who elect Option 1 will research and write parts of white papers and comments to the Federal Communications Commission that will help policy makers assess the available options.  In special cases, students electing Option 1 may take the policy practicum for 2 units. Students interested in this option should indicate this on their application.  Option 2 (1 to 2 units) - In order to elect Option 2, students must concurrently enroll (with consent of instructor) in the seminar component, &quot;Current Issues in Network Neutrality&quot; (2 units), which meets Thursdays from 4:15pm-6:15pm.  Students in the policy practicum with the seminar component will research and write parts of white papers and comments to the Federal Communications Commission that will help policy makers assess the available options Students will be required to attend the seminar and participate in the discussion, but will not do any of the written assignments for the seminar.  Depending on the type of work in Option 1 or Option 2, students taking the policy practicum for two-units or more may receive professional writing (PW) or research (R) credit. Students must obtain the instructor's approval of their election to take the course for writing (PW or W) or research (R) credit.

Habitat mitigation is an important tool under a variety of environmental and wildlife protection statutes, both state and federal. Current regulatory frameworks usually require that habitat mitigation employ permanent easements or long-term contracts fixed in particular locations, despite the fact that species have changing habitat needs.  Many species are migratory and must move across the landscape to survive; a changing climate and shifting human activity only increase the dynamic nature of habitat needs.  To ensure that species and their habitat are protected in the most effective manner possible, legal and policy frameworks must be structured to address this and other challenges.  Additionally, there is a need for a robust market mechanism that recognizes the inherent natural capital and species habitat provided by working agricultural lands, and compensates landowners for the value of those resources.  In the face of significant upcoming conservation and mitigation needs for California, new policies and regulatory frameworks are necessary, and must be rooted in rigorous science, be consistent with existing legal frameworks, and accomplish the dual goals of promoting species recovery and maintaining agricultural production.  Students in the Law and Policy Lab will analyze cutting edge issues related to species habitat and protection.  They will help provide recommendations to the Central Valley Habitat Exchange (CVHE) in the development of more flexible and marketable habitat mitigation tools that can be used under a variety of programs, including the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, state wildlife laws, and the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.  The CVHE is a new initiative taking advantage of the emerging market of habitat credits by maximize the benefits of the habitat that willing agricultural landowners can provide. The CVHE will facilitate investment in conservation and restoration of vital and dynamic Central Valley floodplain and riparian habitat by promoting, monitoring and assisting in the exchange of habitat credits.  Students will tackle issues of permanence and change from legal, policy, economic, and scientific perspectives, depending on their existing skill set and research needs.  During the quarter, visitors from the CVHE Working Group - which includes members from national environmental non-profits, government agencies, and the private sector - will share their perspectives, and students will be invited to present their findings and make recommendations to help inform development of the CVHE.  The course will meet at a mutually convenient time that will be chosen after the quarter begins.  Meetings will include a mix of individual meetings and group meetings.

Students who cannot take all three should probably prioritize them in the order they are listed-that is, Bankruptcy is the single most important course to take, then Secured Credit, then Payment Systems.nElements used in grading:  Final exam","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Secured Credit","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2014-2015"},"435":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"437","course_id":209617,"description":"This course will study how society allocates and protects its most crucial natural resource -- water.

You already know how to think like a lawyer, but if you are interested in policymaking, policy advocacy or policy research&iquest;whether in the public, nonprofit, or corporate sector&iquest; you need to know how to think like a policy analyst as well.  This seminar, designed primarily for students beginning or continuing in Policy Lab practicums, has three purposes.  First, it introduces students to the ways in which policy analysts approach public policy problems and controversies, focusing on perspectives that distinguish policy analysis from traditional legal analysis Second, it introduces students to the tools of policy analysis, including approaches to collecting and analyzing information Third, it provides hand-on lessons on communicating with policy makers orally and in writing.  There is no text for the course. Readings for the course will include examples of policy analyses conducted to inform public policymaking.  Students engaged in policy practicums will use their practicum experience as a basis  for assessing the value of various policy analytic perspectives and research approaches.  Students not engaged in policy practicums will pick a policy problem they are interested in and develop a plan for conducting a policy analysis relevant to this problem.

Some are deontological: we grant rights because this is morally required in a just society. We will examine these various justifications, as well as variants on them. We will also ask how a society, having decided to grant some version of IP rights, ought best structure them. Should they be true property rights, with all or most of the powers this implies (creator control over uses, right to compensation from exploitation, etc.), or something else? Would a state-backed reward system work better, so that compensation is divorced from individual control? Should compensation for successful creators be limited or capped, as part of a wider attempt to moderate the distributional impacts of granting individual property rights; or must we tolerate &iquest;big winners&iquest; as an inducement or symbolic reward for other creators? We will address these and related questions by reading two sets of materials: (1) classic treatments of property rights (Locke, Kant, etc.) and social justice (Rawls); and (2) material from the contemporary literature on IP theory.

On top of political betrayal we shall deal with personal betrayal, especially in the form of infidelity and in the form of financial betrayal of the kind performed by Madoff. The contrasting notions to betrayal, especially loyalty and trust, will get special consideration so as to shed light or cast shadow, as the case may be, on the idea of betrayal. The seminar will focus not only on the normative aspect of betrayal - moral or legal, but also on the psychological motivations for betraying others.

Professor Larry Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, but many of the Law School's esteemed group of Supreme Court litigators will be participating in one or more of the sessions.nnThe 18 students in the seminar will be divided into two courts.  One of these courts will sit five times and the other will sit four times. During each sitting, the court will hear arguments in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix between criminal and civil cases. Each student will be assigned the role of a particular Justice for the entire quarter.  Each student's task while sitting on cases is to do his or her best to understand that particular justice, based on that justice's  prior opinions and judicial philosophy.  In this sense, the seminar is intended to help promote insight into the role of judicial personality and philosophy within the decisional process. The weekly seminars will proceed as follows: In preparation for each week's session, all students (whether they are the two students arguing that week, the nine students judging that week, or the seven students observing that week) will read the lower courts' decisions, the briefs (the party briefs and selected amicus briefs) and the major precedents implicated. During the first portion of each week's session (approximately one hour), two of the students (who are members of the Court that is not sitting that week) will present oral arguments to the nine &quot;justices&quot; sitting that week. The arguments will be based on the briefs that were actually filed in the case. During the second segment of each week's session (approximately 45 minutes), the &quot;justices&quot; who are sitting that week will &quot;conference&quot; the case while the other non-sitting students, students who argued,instructors and guests will observe.  Again, each student will be in the role of a particular justice.  At the end of the &quot;conference,&quot; the opinion-writing will be assigned to one &quot;justice&quot; in the majority and one &quot;justice&quot; in the dissent. During the final portion of each session (approximately one hour), theinstructors, guests and students will engage in a broad discussion of what they just observed.  This may include analysis of the briefing, discussion about the oral argument, reflections on the &quot;conference,&quot; and, more generally, a discussion about the case and its significance. After each class, the student assigned to draft the majority opinion will have two weeks to circulate a draft to the &quot;Court.&quot;  The student writing the dissent will then have two weeks to circulate his or her opinion. The other sitting &quot;justices&quot; can join one of these opinions, request some changes as a condition of joining, or decide to write separately. Over the course of the Quarter, then, each student will argue one case, sit on four or five cases, and draft at least one opinion.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":7,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"W","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"writing","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Supreme Court Simulation Seminar","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2014-2015"},"475":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"616","course_id":211470,"description":"This course will examine the variety of procedures used to develop and manage large-scale litigation within and outside the U.S., and the policy controversies surrounding them.

Becoming a trusted advisor or effective advocate is essentially an interpersonal process that relies upon social and emotional skills, such as listening in ways that gain client trust and engagement or delivering tough messages in ways that reduce defensiveness and increase mutual problem solving.  These skills can be learned.  Unlike conceptual knowledge, they are acquired through practicing new behaviors that expand skills or undo old habits.  Adult learning is strengthened through experiencing the concept in action, reflecting upon the experience and practicing it.

This class seeks to explore both the current trends and the future possibilities of this transformation, as we begin to train the future generation of technology savvy lawyers, and technologists who understand the intricacies and potential of what the law could be.  Legal informatics could be defined as a computational perspective of law:  where does legal information reside, how is it manipulated, and which algorithms and data structures are used in various legal functions?  Note that there are no prerequisites for this class beyond an interest in the subject. There are numerous examples of technologically driven legal transformation. Case law search has moved from hard copy to closed digital systems such as Westlaw and LexisNexis, and into free cloud-based systems such as Google Scholar and Wikipedia.  More and more statutes are available online.  Changes can be seen in e-discovery, privacy, the delivery of (online) legal services, and the budding legal technology startup community.  As a result, questions arise as to the proper statutory and ethical boundaries between humans and machines in implementing legal activities. Beyond the current and near-term technologies, however, are core academic and philosophical questions that will have increasing import as machines gain in sophistication and capability. For example, although the law differentiates between the responsibility assignable to minors compared to adults, we are far from identifying the point at which an agent or robot is morally responsible for its own actions, as opposed to the responsibility being assigned to its creator.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Legal Technology and Informatics","units_max":3,"units_min":2,"year":"2014-2015"},"489":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"669","course_id":213335,"description":"A lawyer who communicates not only in a cerebrally persuasive way, but also in an emotionally gripping way, has an enormous strategic advantage.

This course - conducted by a television and film writer who is also a lawyer with experience in all three branches of government, private practice, political campaigns, and a labor union - teaches how to compose an engaging story and how to apply those skills to a variety of legal situations.  The first part of the course will cover the art of storytelling on both a theoretical and a practical track.  On the theoretical track, students will study story drive; narrative structure; beginnings, middles, and ends; openings; plot and character; exposition; and transitions. The class will have a healthy amount of assigned reading and viewing that illustrate each of these components in literature, drama, and film. On the practical track, students will undertake writing exercises that parallel the theoretical discussion, to develop a first-hand facility with those facets of storytelling.  In the second part of the course, students will apply their storytelling insights and skills to specific legal situations: A criminal case. An appellate case. A legislative proposal. A labor negotiation. A public relations crisis. Students will discuss in depth their narrative approaches to these situations, along with those taken by lawyers in other cases in the respective areas.

This course is offered to &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; so that you will not be at a disadvantage in other courses at the Law School that draw on economic ideas (or, just as importantly, not be at a disadvantage when you graduate and you encounter economic ideas and arguments on the job or in life.)So, what is economics, exactly?  All societies face the problem of scarcity - there are not enough resources to satisfy people's desires for all things. Economics studies how individuals and societies deal with scarcity and the mechanisms for deciding what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets the output.  It is as simple and complex as that!  As you can imagine, the practical applications are nearly endless. Please note that the course focus will be microeconomics - the branch of economics that focuses on the economic behavior of individual decision-making units, such as households and firms, and how these individual decisions fit together.  (I will not discuss macroeconomics in this course - i.e. the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly inflation, unemployment, and business cycles.) More specifically, I will spend the vast majority of the course taking you through the basic supply and demand model of markets - what it is, where it came from, how and when it works, and when it does not work so well.  With that base, I can branch out accordingly to help you apply it to a wide variety of relevant issues. Though I will not focus specifically on how economic ideas have been used in a legal context (there is another course and seminar that does that), I will make some effort to link the economic ideas we discuss directly to legal topics. COURSE PROCEDURE: My primary goal is to teach you the fundamental principles of microeconomics by (1) providing you the relevant schema to understand the basic tools of economic analysis; and by (2) drilling you extensively with problems, cases, current events, and other applied materials so as to help you develop the ability to use these tools and truly make them your own. A heavy emphasis will be placed on building a conceptual understanding of some key economic models, looking closely at the underlying assumptions of those models, and engaging in the process of questioning and relaxing those assumptions in the context of actual &quot;real life&quot; issues. Please do not mistake the analytical rigor I will require, to mean that we will use sophisticated mathematics.  To the contrary, I believe that most powerful economic principles should be highly intuitive and non-quantitative.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Introduction to Microeconomics","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2014-2015"},"493":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"679","course_id":213992,"description":"We will seek to determine a useful meaning of the notion of the rule of law to identify some measurement of adherence and to explore the importance of the rule of law in terms of economic, socio-political and human development.

With some exceptions, that system is characterized by relatively stable political and legal institutions, low levels of explicit corruption, high bureaucratic capacity in public organizations, and relatively open, impersonal access to political, policymaking, and legal institutions. Although these characteristics are now often taken for granted, the process through which they emerged remains remarkably opaque. In the 1780s under the Articles of Confederation, the United States was a poor developing country on the fringe of the Atlantic community with limited capacity and a striking inability to provide basic public goods, such as security. One hundred years later, it well along the way to becoming the richest nation in the world. How did this transformation occur? Drawing on judicial opinions, legal scholarship, political science, economics, and history, this course explores how institutions evolved to create such a system. It traces the problem of institutional development through several critical periods in the history of American public law, including the emergence of the Constitution, the events leading up to and following the Civil War, the Progressive era, World War II, institutional changes occurring roughly during 1964-75, and the emergence of the modern administrative state.

The particular lens through which we will investigate this issue involves those who cross, or reflect upon in novel ways, some of these boundaries. As we read and discuss narrative accounts, we will consider what light they shed on how social and legal boundaries are created, evolve, and take on particular meanings. We will ask how law constructs or enforces lines, and how those practices change when the line itself gets blurry. Materials will include fiction and nonfiction, prose and film, on subjects such as: stories of &quot;passing&quot; (involving race and gender); the Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings relationship; attempts by Palestinians and Israelis to live peacefully with one another in the cooperative village of Wahat al-Salam\/Neve Shalom; various narratives about life on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border; and stories about the intersection of religion and sexuality.

In five two-hour sessions at Professor McConnell's home, we will cover (1) Jesus's arrest in the the Garden of Gethsemane, (2) his trial before Jewish authorities, (3) his trial before Roman authorities, and (4) his execution, with (5) one session left for general considerations. (We will not delve into the reports of his resurrection.) We will focus on the nature of the charges against Jesus, the legal procedures employed, the evidence and the defense, the relation between imperial and local authorities, the relation between religious and secular law, the ethical roles of the individuals involved, and the mode of execution. Our primary text will be Raymond E. Brown, The Death of the Messiah (Yale University Press 2004), a scholarly two-volume study drawing on all the extant historical sources.  Among the questions we are likely to discuss are: Was the trial fair by the standards of the day? Was Jesus guilty of any of the charges? What were the authorities - and particularly Pilate - trying to accomplish? What was the role of the mob? Was Roman law a constraining influence, or the opposite? What was Jesus's own perspective on the proceedings? How reliable and\/or plausible are the sources?  Although this subject is of religious and spiritual concern to some, including (in all likelihood) some students taking the seminar, the seminar will not consider the material in a religious way, but instead as a legal event. The instructor hopes that the class will be religiously diverse, and especially encourages non-Christian students to enroll. Discussion will, of course, be conducted in a way that is comfortable for persons of all shades of belief and disbelief.  Begin in Winter Quarter and run through Spring Quarter.

In this seminar, we will take stock of key global developments that underlie such a transformation, and analyze their impact on the future of human rights, as follows: nn1. The rise of emerging powers (such as Brazil, China and India) and the relative decline of Europe and the U.S. point to a multipolar world order. Together with the proliferation of international regulations (such as transnational corporations' codes of conduct, legal standards advanced by coalitions of NGOs, and decisions of international bodies such as the WTO and UN agencies), this trend results in a legal and political arena that is both broader and more fragmented. In this new context, states and NGOs in the Global North no longer control the creation and implementation of human rights standards, while new actors (from transnational social movements to Global South states and NGOs) emerge as influential voices.  nn2. Information and communication technologies present new challenges and opportunities for human rights. As the mobilizations catalyzed by the Arab Spring have shown, tools such as social networks, video documentaries, digital reporting, online learning and long-distance education can accelerate political change, reduce the informational disadvantages suffered by marginalized groups, and bring together national, regional and global groups capable of making a direct impact on the protection of rights. nn3. The range of actors and legal and political strategies has been considerably expanded. Time-honored strategies such as naming and shaming recalcitrant states are being complemented with newer strategies for transnational research, information circulation, and training, which involve a host of different actors, including social movements, online media outlets, inter-governmental organizations, universities and virtual activist networks.nnThe seminar will be divided into three sections, each dealing with one of these transformations. Each section, in turn, will be divided into two discussion sessions and one lecture by a leading scholar and\/or practitioner.nnThe seminar will revolve around the discussion of the assigned readings and materials, as well as presentations by students and guest speakers. Grades will be based on an in-class presentation and a final paper.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"The Future of Human Rights: Law, Politics, and Social Justice in a Multipolar, Multimedia World","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2014-2015"},"504":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"684","course_id":214082,"description":"(Same as ETHICSOC 301)This experimental course looks at conflicts of interest and ethical issues as they arise within academic work.

After more than ten years, this question is still hotly debated around the world. Network neutrality rules limit the ability of Internet service providers to interfere with the applications, content and services on their networks; they allow users to decide how they want to use the Internet without interference from Internet service providers.  In the US, the recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in Verizon v. FCC has re-opened the debate. In December 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the Open Internet Order, which enacted binding network neutrality rules for the first time. In January of this year, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the core provisions of the Open Internet Order - the rules against blocking and discrimination. As a result of this ruling, Internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T or Cox Cable that connect users to the Internet are now free to block any content, service or application they want. They can slow down selected applications, speed up others, or ask application or content providers like Netflix or Spotify to pay fees to reach their users. These practices would fundamentally change how we experience the Internet. In the wake of the Court's decision, policy makers, stakeholders and observers in the US are debating how to best ensure that the Internet remains open and free. In February, the Federal Communications Commission opened a new docket to collect public input on the best way to proceed. In Europe, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the member states are currently considering which approach to network neutrality they should take. The Brazilian Parliament is in the process of adopting network neutrality rules.  This seminar aims to enable students to participate in the ongoing policy debates over network neutrality in the US and abroad. Class sessions will explore whether there is a need for network neutrality rules and, if yes, what kind of rules a network neutrality regime should include. For example, should network neutrality rules only ban blocking, or also discrimination? And if yes, what kind of differential treatment should be banned? Should Internet service providers be allowed to charge application or content providers for prioritized or otherwise enhanced access to their Internet service customers? How can we find network neutrality rules that allow network providers to manage their networks and that allow innovation in the network, while protecting the interests of users and application developers? Does competition in the market for Internet services remove the need for network neutrality rules? And finally, what is the best way to move forward in the US?  Students will work in groups on written assignments that explore specific questions from the perspective of particular Internet companies or interest groups. Students are expected to attend all sessions of the class and participate in the class discussion.  Special Instructions:  Students may submit consent applications to enroll in the &quot;Current Issues in Network Neutrality&quot; seminar and the &quot;Next Steps in Network Neutrality&quot; policy lab practicum.  Students concurrently accepted in the seminar and the policy practicum will research and write parts of white papers and comments to the Federal Communications Commission that will help policy makers assess the available options.  Students will be required to attend the seminar and participate in the discussion, but will not do any of the written assignments for the seminar. Students enrolled in the seminar and the practicum will have the option to write papers for W, PW, or R credit in the practicum, with instructor consent.  The class is open to law students and students from other parts of the university. It does not require any technical background.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation, attendance, written assignments.  Writing (W) credit is for 3Ls only.

These are just a few examples of alleged corporate malfeasance that have emerged on the international stage.  The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the debate concerning the accountability of transnational corporations that are complicit in rights-violating activities.  At the international level, there has been a striking new strategy in the protection of human rights: a transition from focusing solely on rights-violations committed by governments to a detailed examination of transnational corporate conduct.  Indeed, it has now become trite to say that particular corporations have directly or indirectly participated in violations of human rights.  In order to address the fundamental question of whether corporations should in fact be socially responsible, the seminar will begin with an introduction to corporate theory.  Students will then explore some of the key issues in the debate.  Namely, whether transnational corporations can properly be included under the international law of state responsibility; mechanisms for self-regulation (e.g. voluntary corporate codes of conduct); the utility of the U.S. Alien Tort Claims Act; the advantages and disadvantages of U.N. initiatives (e.g. the work of the former U.N. Special Representative on Business and Human Rights); and the relevance of domestic corporate and securities law mechanisms (e.g. shareholder proposals and social disclosure).

We will spend the first week of the course learning some background about sexual violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for women. We will study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. Starting the second week we will travel first to New York City, and then to Washington D.C., where we will meet with journalists, activists, experts, policymakers, elected officials, and others who are actively involved in shaping the national response to this issue. Confirmed guests speakers include New York Times reporter Emily Bazelon; Catherine Lhamon, the Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights; and the Office of Senator Kristin Gillibrand (D.N.Y.). On our return to campus students will create and present final projects. Travel expenses to NYC and DC (except incidentals) are provided by Sophomore College.  Students are expected to do all readings, and participate in all class sessions, meals, field trips, films, and discussions. Requirements include three short papers, preparing and helping to lead discussions with outside speakers, and the development and presentation of a final group-designed project which can include a multi-media or artistic component.  The subject matter of this course is sensitive and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Moreover, much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and\/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources and Title IX staff are available for those who need them. Please consider this prior to enrolling in the course.

Seems simple enough. But advertisements in the back of newspapers still announce: Single White Female Seeks Single White Male?  Isn't that discrimination on the basis of race and sex? Most businesses don't consider men for women's locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren't those men and women's bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation?  After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn't it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women to wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We'll answer these and many other questions by looking court cases, legal theory and philosophy. We may also have conversations with guest lecturers who work in civil rights enforcement and the seminar may include a field trip to visit the offices of civil rights lawyers (lawyers tend to be busy people so these opportunities will depend on their schedules.)

What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in human rights advocacy?  In the space of sixty years, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discussion, if not practice.  In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.  This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.).  The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights;  4) to understand how recent history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice.  During the course of the quarter you will be required to submit several short reflection papers and develop a human rights advocacy campaign.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":30232,"component":"ISF","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":17,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2015","end_time":"10:15:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"James","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Cavallaro","middle_name":"L","name":"Cavallaro, J.","sunet_id":"james62"}],"location":"William H.
