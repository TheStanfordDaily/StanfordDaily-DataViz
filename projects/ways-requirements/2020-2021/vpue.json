Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2020-2021"},"7":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

How do literature and philosophy help us to understand ourselves and to achieve our social, ethical, and personal ideals? In this class, we examine Socrates and Augustine's lives and ideas.  Each struggled to live a good and happy life.  In each case, they urge us to transform ourselves into better human beings.  The first half of the course focuses on the Athenian Socrates, who was put to death because he rejected traditional Greek ideals and and proclaimed a new kind of ethical goodness.  The second half focuses on the North African Augustine, an unhappy soul who became a new man by converting to Christianity.  These thinkers addressed questions and problems that we still confront today:  What do we consider to be a happy life?  Do we need to be good and ethical people to live happily?  Is there one correct set of values?  How do we accommodate other people's beliefs?  Is it possible to experience a transformation of the self?

Through a variety of philosophical and empirical readings, we will explore the fundamental challenges of democracy and discuss how we see them playing out today.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: The Democratic Citizen","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2020-2021"},"21":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"12","course_id":219201,"description":"In Greek tragedies, a horrific catastrophe falls upon a person and brings on extreme suffering.  For the Greeks, tragic plays offered the truth about life's calamities and horrors.  The Greeks enjoyed these plays because the dramatic artistry made beauty out of horror and suffering.  The Greeks did not believe that they controlled their fates.  The Greeks had a &quot;tragic wisdom&quot; that enabled them to confront the hardships of life and the inevitability of death.  This helped them to develop courage and resilience.  Plato attacked this view and introduced a new kind of hero, the philosopher Socrates.  As Plato claimed, we can control our fates by practicing philosophy:  this enables us to become wise and ethically good.  The philosopher strives for this goodness, which is beautiful in the highest possible way--it is our soul's true desire.  Our inner goodness is under our control, so the good and wise person will stay happy even when calamities strike.  Plato's optimistic philosophy flew in the face of Greek tragic wisdom.  Plato offered a new way of living, one based on higher education, the development of knowledge, and the pursuit of true beauty and goodness.

How do tragic plays, movies, or TV shows represent the horrors that happen in the real world?  Does the art that makes them beautiful and pleasurable help us to confront these horrors?  Who are our heroes?  What actions or qualities make them heroic?  We read six tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides, and three Platonic dialogues (Apology, Symposium, Republic).

All ethical systems train the individual to relinquish self-interest in favor of a larger communal good. When you applied to Stanford, you answered many application questions designed to elicit evidence of your ability to serve others, which is considered a sign of good character, leadership, and ability to thrive beyond the confines of your family and private world. Knowing you've wrestled with this question at length, showing sacrifice, endurance, empathy, and understanding of higher goods, this course asks you to examine the nation's view. How can the nation present itself as worthy of your personal sacrifice? Do you need to believe in the greatness of your nation to serve? What kind of cause demands your devotion? Nations have differently articulated such a commitment. Some make modest demands and promise you your own sovereignty. Others request only that you dream of national greatness as your own and that you lend a hand. But all nations require at some point, everything from you. What and when are you prepared to give? This course begins with the shortest and most powerful demand for the last full measure your devotion.

All ethical systems train the individual to relinquish self-interest in favor of a larger communal good. When you applied to Stanford, you answered many application questions designed to elicit evidence of your ability to serve others, which is considered a sign of good character, leadership, and ability to thrive beyond the confines of your family and private world. Knowing you've wrestled with this question at length, showing sacrifice, endurance, empathy, and understanding of higher goods, this course asks you to examine the nation's view. How can the nation present itself as worthy of your personal sacrifice? Do you need to believe in the greatness of your nation to serve? What kind of cause demands your devotion? Nations have differently articulated such a commitment. Some make modest demands and promise you your own sovereignty. Others request only that you dream of national greatness as your own and that you lend a hand. But all nations require at some point, everything from you. What and when are you prepared to give? This course begins with the shortest and most powerful demand for the last full measure your devotion.

This course is built around a series of conversations between nine scholar\/critic and artist pairs. We will be entering the conversation in media res, as it were, since all of these pairs have histories together; they've had studio visits, late-night phone calls, email and text conversations. Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work.

In this Bing Overseas Seminar, Stanford students will travel to Tamba to undertake an intensive introduction to forming and firing clay.  Lectures, discussions and studio demos will build a broad view of traditional aesthetic elements of yakishime, but at the same time, students will be encouraged to explore a modern individualistic approach to creative process to help them develop their own expressive forms.  The seminar culminates in a traditional wood firing reaching kiln temperatures in excess of 2300F, which is a process that one must experience first-hand to viscerally comprehend.

Topics for particular study could include &quot;expressionism,&quot; &quot;phenomenology,&quot; &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit,&quot; the Bauhaus, &quot;epic theater,&quot; proletarian art, and early German cinema, more or less following the organization of the Sourcebook.  The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.  Students will be encouraged to base their written projects on these events and on research at local archives, such as the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bauhaus-Museum.  Trips to institutions in other cities (Dessau, Weimar, etc.) could also be considered.  Primarily in English, but some topics might require German. n nThe Symphony  Material covered in this independent study could be adjusted to the student's interest and knowledge,  depending on his\/her level of musical literacy.  He\/she could focus on cultural history or on more technical, analytical  issues.  The aim will be to trace the history of the genre from its roots in the early 18th century to the present day using  mainly works from the established repertory as examples.  Visits to live performances in Berlin may also be included. n nBeethoven in German Culture  Following last year's elections in Germany, the draft coalition contract included the  following statement: &quot;The 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in 2020 offers excellent opportunities for profiling  German culture at home and abroad. Preparing for this important anniversary is thus of national concern.&quot; How and why  did Beethoven become so crucially important in German culture? In trying to answer this question, the course will begin  with a survey of Beethoven's life and works, and then focus on his legacy via key moments in reception history.

Through Fugard's plays, students confront signifcant issues in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Set in the confines of the theater, these confrontations paradoxically generate a fuller engagement with the issues than we often get from accounts in the disciplines of history orpolitcal science. As Picasso once said, &quot;Art is the lie that tells the truth,&quot; and Fugard's theater tries to do that. In studying his plays, students will learn a different kind of truth about social and historical realities that have faced South Africans over the past six decades.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":34384,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPCPTWN","tags":[],"title":"In and Out of the Margins: The Plays of Athol Fugard","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"134":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGCAPE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"}],"code":"36","course_id":209971,"description":"Archaeology, history and ethnography of the aboriginal hunter gatherers of southern Africa, the San people.

Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers.

From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to glory; Boccaccio's love, so sensual and yet so deeply rooted in the human soul as to cause the greatest joy or the deepest despair; Ariosto's love, a dangerous force that can drive people to madness in a world where, after all, everyone is somehow in love and therefore partly (and delightfully) crazy; Machiavelli's love, which can sharpen one's wits and bring with it great achievements, unless it clouds one's judgement and leads to failure; Aretino's love, so unabashedly physical and graphically explicit as to cause scandal and amazement all over Europe. We will also look at how love is described by Veronica Gambara, Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa and other women poets of the Renaissance who renewed the lyrical code from within, giving new meanings to old words. We will also listen to the various kinds of love put to music in operas from Don Giovanni to Traviata and Boh&egrave;me, and we will investigate how love interrelates with history in Manzoni's Promessi sposi and other Romantic historical novels. Finally, we will explore how the previous (male) narratives about love were reconfigured and reinvented by female novelists of the 20th century such as Goliarda Sapienza, Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante, who will lead us to delve into Elena Ferrante's works, where love constantly interplays with friendship, and often confirms that, for better or for worse, appearances can be deceiving.

This course will examine emotions from a cross cultural perspective and has three course objectives: (1) to increase students' awareness of how cultural ideas and practices shape their emotions by comparing their experiences in Kyoto with those in the U.S., (2) to teach students to apply a scientific understanding of culture and emotion to their experiences in Kyoto, and (3) to teach students how to formulate and test hypotheses about emotions in Japan vs. U.S. The proposed course will be comprised of three sections. The first section will focus on dominant theories of culture and emotions and the ways in which they are scientifically measured using a variety of self-report, behavioral, and physiological\/neural measures. The second section  will cover three patterns that emerge from the scientific literature regarding U.S.-East Asian differences in the focus of emotion, views of emotional expression, and values regarding emotional experience. Because much of the literature on culture and emotion focuses on U.S. and Japanese comparisons, the empirical findings will be directly applicable to the students studying at Kyoto. The third section will focus on the role of culture and emotion in applied settings (work, educational, and clinical) in the US and Japan. Students' structured and unstructured experiences and observations living in Kyoto will be the basis of our class discussions and will be linked to course material. For instance, students may be asked to analyze the themes and narratives of popular Japanese anime, art, and architecture based on methods introduced in class. As a comparison, students will identify products and practices in the U.S. that illustrate similarities and differences between the two cultures. Students will write short papers each week linking their experiences to the assigned material. At the end of the quarter, students will make short presentations about another aspect of emotion they hypothesize varies in the U.S. and Japan, based on their own experiences in Kyoto, and discuss how they might design a study to test their hypotheses. Readings will include sections from popular books and accessible academic chapters and empirical articles.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPKYOTO","tags":[],"title":"Feeling in Japan: Culture, Emotion, and Brain","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2020-2021"},"236":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGKYOT","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"101K","course_id":220638,"description":"Goal is to express thoughts and opinions in paragraph length in spoken and written forms.

We will apply range of scholarly approaches to these works and their lives on film and in the theatre, including close reading, performance studies, critical race studies, queer studies, and gender studies. Students will be introduced to these methodological frameworks early in the course, and are free to apply any of them in their assignments. Throughout our exploration of these canonical works, we will consider how today's theatre and film makers, as well as their audiences, engage with these plays to make new meanings and interventions in contemporary culture. Central to our discussion will be an interrogation of the place of Shakespeare in contemporary British culture, chiefly through analysis of performances of his plays and those of his contemporaries in major national institutions: Shakespeare's Globe, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC, and the mainstream film industry. At the same time, however, we will be equally concerned with how marginalised groups, including minority ethnic and queer artists, have turned to Shakespeare's plays in order to reposition his works, and themselves, on the global and political stage. These in-class discussions, supported by study-group preparation, will prepare students for the written assignments, which are designed to allow students to interpret these plays and their theatrical\/filmic afterlives, with a particular focus on the social and political implications of staging and screening these plays in today's diverse British society. Each week, students will be expected to have read the set text (a play by either Shakespeare or his contemporaries) and, in one of three 'study groups,' to have engaged with a critical or interpretative response to that text based on assigned reading or viewing (usually a scholarly reading, or a film or theatrical adaptation).","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":30428,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Spring","units":"4-5"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":23098,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Sep 3, 2021","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephanie","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Solywoda","middle_name":"","name":"Solywoda, S.","sunet_id":"solywoda"},{"first_name":"Harry","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"McCarthy","middle_name":"R.","name":"McCarthy, H.","sunet_id":"harryrm"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jun 30, 2021","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Summer","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"taps","organization":"OSP"}],"title":"Shakespeare and Performance","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"305":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"code":"61","course_id":223281,"description":"What is it like to start your own company?

Where is this food produced and how is it brought to the city? What recent initiatives promote a more sustainable food system in France? These questions offer an opportunity to explore broader issues related to food systems in the urban era, rural-urban linkages, and sustainable food consumption, using Paris as a case study. The objective of this course is to better understand the food system of a large citysuch as Paris, with a focus on the underlying human-environment interactions. Part I of the course will focus on food production in the peri-urban areas of Paris and other regions in France. 70% of the food consumed in Paris comes from France. We will start with von Thunen's model of the central state.We will also discuss the rise of urban agriculture, with a field visit of an urban agriculture site under the municipality's &quot;Parisculteurs&quot;program. Part II will focus on food distribution and consumption in the city. We will discuss concepts such as agglomeration economies and supply chains. We will conduct interviews atan open-air market in Paris where &laquo;mara&icirc;chers&raquo; bring in their own production to sell. Part III will focus on recent trends to increase the sustainability of food production in France. We will discuss emerging social norms related to sustainable food and how they interact with agricultural and environmental policies in France and the European Union. This will include the rise of organic agriculture, geographical indications, various public and private eco-labeling initiatives, and attitudes toward genetically-modified crops in France.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":32062,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"}],"title":"FOOD CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"400":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"67","course_id":222943,"description":"The following topics areproposed for an independent study: (1)Land use history in France:After centuries of deforestation, French landscapes have been reforesting for more than a century.

What explains this trend? How is the organic agriculture standard defined in Europe? What are the health and environmental benefits of organic agriculture?(3) Outsourcing ecological footprints to other continents:The environmental impacts of France's consumption within its borders are decreasing. But does it reflect a decoupling between economic activity and environmental degradation, or is it just the result of a displacement of the most polluting activities to other countries? (4) Sustainability sourcing commitments by corporate actors: A growing number of multinational corporations are making sustainability sourcing commitments. Does the country (or continent) where these companies are based or sell their products have an influence on the likelihood of making such commitments?(5) Geographical Indications (GIs) in Europe: GIs identify a good as originating from a region where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is attributable to its geographical origin.

The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class. Issues of resilience will be discussed in relation to major disasters including floods, extreme storms and climate change. The 7 global resilience targets will be identified according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The major components of resilience will be reviewed in class followed by a visit to or by a representative from the 100 Resilient City Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Superstorm Sandy in 2012 will be used as a case study to identify the disaster impact to the urban environment in NYC. We will discuss the emergency response of the City after Sandy and assess the performance of the NYC resilience plan. We will explore how New York City is preparing to respond and recover from future major disasters as part of the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. n nNovel technologies will be discussed in terms of their implications for disaster resilience and sustainability.

Greg Accomando of the NYPD Special Victim's Division, Abagail Nelson the Senior Vice President for Programs at Episcopal Relief &amp; Development, and Deborah Hayashi of the North Central Bronx Sexual Assault Response Team. n nThrough these frameworks and studies, the course offers a well-rounded introduction to the complexity of interventions against gender based discrimination in the context of a Global City. The transnational scope of the course is anchored by New York City as an incubator and instigator for innovative interventions against gender inequality, and there will be an emphasis on the cross-pollination that occurs between the City, State and national and international NGO platforms.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":30536,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Spring","units":"4"}],"subject":"SINY","tags":[],"title":"Safe Cities: A Study of Institutional Responses to Gender Based Violence in the Global City","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"532":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGNYC","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"170","course_id":222040,"description":"The purpose of the class is to provide an overview of basic business concepts and tools with a focus on practicality.

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

This course will expose you to multiple ways of approaching the cancer problem, including laboratory research, clinical trials, population studies, public health interventions, and health care economics. We will start with the 18th century discovery of the relationship between coal tar and cancer, and trace the role of scientific research in revealing the genetic basis of cancer. We will then discuss the development of new treatments for cancer as well as measures to screen for and prevent cancer, including the ongoing debate over tobacco control. Using cancer as a case study, you will learn important aspects of the scientific method including experimental design, data analysis, and the difference between correlation and causation.  You will learn how science can be used and misused with regard to the public good.

With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender.

What does it mean for people to experience the supernatural? How do we understand belief in God? How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others?

Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear.

In this course, students will explore questions about the Universe, its beginnings, its structure, its extent, its fate, from several perspectives - philosophical, experimental, and theoretical.

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"evaluate how existing social arrangements create and maintain social differences among people."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"assess and synthesize evidence about programs and interventions designed to promote diversity and inclusion."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"ccguide","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"PDCert","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"all","organization":"FEMST"}],"title":"Why So Few?

Culture informs and distorts how we discern, accept, reject, and analyze our bodies. Looking at literary, medical, ethical, and anthropological texts, we ask how representations of the body affects the way we experience illness, embody gender and racial identities, and understand our rights (or lack of rights) to control our own bodies.

You will be introduced to the basic theory and art of storytelling, enabling you to understand and master the fundamentals of narrative structure, plot, and character. This will allow you to practice producing your own stories through both interpretative and creative writing assignments. The class will also give students the chance to participate in various story-making activities and work with the Stanford Storytelling Project, San Francisco StoryCorps, School of the Arts and the

We will address the question of allocation at the level of health policy and health economics before applying the concepts to the institutional and bedside level. Using real world examples, you will be asked to actively engage in debating controversial topics such as organ transplants and how to assign scarce ICU beds. Using both empirical data and the framework of ethics, you will be asked to consider how a health care committee, or a hospital, or an individual doctor might make

It will engage with thinkers who argued in favor of the idea of progress as well as thinkers who attacked its presumptions.

find ourselves in an age of rapidly evolving technology, where the world we inhabit, increasingly, is the world we make.  At Stanford, you will find many courses that ask you to make things&iquest;everything from algorithms, products, policies, to artworks.  What is rarer is to be given the space to stop and really think about why&iquest;for what and for whom&iquest;we design these things, and whether we should continue to design in ways demanded by commercial and political actors.  This critical thinking course examines the nature, purpose, and meaning of design in human life, and asks the fundamental questions of &iquest;what is design?&iquest;, &iquest;why do we do it?&iquest;, and &iquest;how do design, technology, and society shape one another?&iquest;. We will explore design as a series of choices and the ways in which we make these choices. This course will consider different models of design in our world today: from need-based design (as we are often taught) to the fashioning of tools that help us flourish as human beings. You will learn about various aesthetic and ethical frameworks and a fundamental language of design, so that you can begin to critically analyze everyday examples of media, tools, toys, and games&iquest;and apply such lenses to designing conscientiously. You will learn to think about the design of social networks, artificial intelligence, musical instruments, games, virtual reality, and other examples&iquest;in terms of needs and values, ethics and aesthetics. In short, through this course, you will learn to more clearly and critically view our technology-drenched human world&iquest;and to exercise your ethical and artful imagination to reimagine better worlds.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter

course asks a question that can elicit a variety of responses. Classical music means different things to different people. For some it connotes Western art music of a particular historical era. According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free. Aesthetic interests and prejudices come into play, whether implicitly or explicitly.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":18033,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":3,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday","Friday"],"end_date":"Aug 27, 2021","end_time":"10:50:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kirstin","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Haag","middle_name":"","name":"Haag, K.","sunet_id":"kfhaag"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Jun 21, 2021","start_time":"10:00:00 AM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2020-2021 Summer","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":16484,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Aug 27, 2021","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kirsten","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Paige","middle_name":"","name":"Paige, K.","sunet_id":"kpaige"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Jun 21, 2021","start_time":"12:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2020-2021 Summer","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":19881,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Aug 27, 2021","end_time":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kirsten","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Paige","middle_name":"","name":"Paige, K.","sunet_id":"kpaige"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Jun 21, 2021","start_time":"2:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2020-2021 Summer","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":16455,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":19,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":80,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Aug 27, 2021","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hinton","middle_name":"","name":"Hinton, S.","sunet_id":"shinton"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Jun 21, 2021","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Summer","units":"4"}],"subject":"THINK","tags":[],"title":"What Makes Music Classical?","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"575":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"68","course_id":221373,"description":"Genomes reveal a wealth of information with implications far beyond the linear sequence of the DNA.

But what is the purpose of this journey? Why go to college? Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary,  that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation with more recent works. We will consider the relevance of liberal education to all areas of study, from STEM to the arts, and its relations to future careers. And we will examine the central place that the idea of 'the good life' has historically enjoyed in theories of liberal education. You will be prompted to examine your own life, to question how and why you make decisions, and to argue for your views while respecting those of others. Maybe you will conclude that a liberal education is no longer relevant in the twenty-first century, but we hope that you will do so armed with a thorough understanding of what it has been and what it can be.nIn the end, college is less about what you will do in life, than about what kind of person you will be. So: what kind of person do you want to be? What kind of life will you live? Join us as we explore what others have said about these questions and prepare to answer them for yourself.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":29209,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"11:15:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Edelstein","middle_name":"","name":"Edelstein, D.","sunet_id":"danedels"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":"10:00:00 AM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30748,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"1:45:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Sara","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Mrsny","middle_name":"","name":"Mrsny, S.","sunet_id":"smrsny"},{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":"12:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"06","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30746,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"11:45:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Sara","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Mrsny","middle_name":"","name":"Mrsny, S.","sunet_id":"smrsny"},{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"05","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30744,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"2:15:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kathryn","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Lum","middle_name":"Gin","name":"Lum, K.","sunet_id":"kgin"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":"1:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30667,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":9,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":13,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"5:45:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"R.","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Anderson","middle_name":"Lanier","name":"Anderson, R.","sunet_id":"lanier"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":"4:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18635,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":58,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":100,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2020","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kathryn","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Lum","middle_name":"Gin","name":"Lum, K.","sunet_id":"kgin"},{"first_name":"Dan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Edelstein","middle_name":"","name":"Edelstein, D.","sunet_id":"danedels"},{"first_name":"R.","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Anderson","middle_name":"Lanier","name":"Anderson, R.","sunet_id":"lanier"}],"location":"Remote","start_date":"Sep 14, 2020","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2020-2021 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"THINK","tags":[],"title":"Why College?

What advantages can be found in the deep, risky waters of uncertainty?  Can ambivalent texts move and persuade us? In this course, we'll explore such questions in an attempt to understand the relationship between ambivalence and persuasion. We'll analyze and discuss the ways that writers such as Annie Dillard, Stephen Jay Gould, and Michael Pollan not only engage their ambivalence but weave it into their prose. Most importantly, we'll explore how you can develop rhetorical strategies and habits of mind to achieve results in your own analytical and persuasive writing. We'll study how to craft compelling arguments that do fuller justice to complex emotions and ideas.For course videos and full descriptions, see https:\/\/vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu.

Have you ever noticed that you change the way you speak to present a particular social identity? For example, have you ever switched between dialects or languages to show alignment with certain social groups or mark your 'in-group' status? Because language is flexible (and somewhat controllable), it can be used as a resource to create and index identity. However, given its flexible nature, criticizing someone's language often becomes a more socially acceptable way of attacking someone than something that seems like bald-faced racism\/sexism\/homophobia, etc.  In this course we'll explore this complex link between identity and language.nnThis course explores the way language and social identity are defined, discussed, and debated in America, and the assumptions this rhetoric presents about race, class, education and other social identities more broadly.  Together, we&iquest;ll consider: What's it like to grow up monolingual versus bilingual or multilingual? What role do our ethnicity and\/or race play in how our language skills are perceived? What role do language attitudes and stereotypes play in influencing our daily lives? What role does the media play? How is language discussed in politics?

In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family?","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: It's All Relative: The Rhetoric of the Modern American Family","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"709":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1 Requirement","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"1WG","course_id":210546,"description":"Rhetorical analysis of readings, research, and argument.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story.

But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
