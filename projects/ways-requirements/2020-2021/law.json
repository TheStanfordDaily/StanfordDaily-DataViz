Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rooted in the idea that shareholder value is not the only measure of a firm's value and, indeed, that the exclusive pursuit of profits may produce social harms.  The seminar will consider a variety of legal issues related to CSR, including: 1.  The meaning and measure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria for corporations.  2.  The voluntary or mandatory disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks.  3.  When is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social and environment goals?  4.  Constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization.  5.  The power of investors to influence corporate behavior through capital allocation-investments (including impact investing) and divestments-and shareholder activism.  6.

Rules---written and implied---divide formal from casual attire and children's clothing from that of adults. There are rules for what to wear in each season of the year and rules about the right attire for different times of the day. And, of course, there are rules about the types of clothing men may wear and about the clothing suitable for women. Adherence to such rules is considered by many to be an important signal of breeding and even character: accordingly, immediate social sanctions---and indirect professional consequences---can follow from breaking them. Some dress codes are job requirements or house rules of an organization or establishment---flouting them can get one fired, kicked out of school or barred from a restaurant. Finally, there are laws about clothing, enforced by police or government officials. Break these rules and you may find yourself facing a fine or even a jail sentence. Why is attire so rule bound? Why and when is clothing important enough to become the subject of written treatises, rules and regulations, legislative proclamations and judicial edicts? This seminar will explore dress codes, from the sumptuary laws of the late Middle Ages to the unstated norms of the 21st century, and discover what they can tell us about the significance of clothing---our most conspicuous medium of self-expression---and its relationship to individual identity, community cohesiveness and social order.

Legal institutions incentivize innovation and allocate access to knowledge goods through a variety of mechanisms, including intellectual property, direct funding through grants and national laboratories, tax incentives, and innovation inducement prizes. In this discussion group, we will examine how these bodies of law are used both to reinforce and subvert existing power structures and inequalities, including issues related to gender, race, geography, and income. We will discuss inequalities among innovators as well as inequalities in access to new innovations, or in who those innovations are made for.

Our current social and technological moment promises increased access to basic legal information without economic or geographic boundaries.  But access and accessibility remain influenced by identity, privilege, and power.  What are our collective expectations for governments to provide legal information in the digital age?  How does access to free, easy-to-use, reliable legal information -- or the lack thereof -- have an impact on low-income and other marginalized communities, particularly in how they exercise their rights and protect themselves from harm?  By examining how some of the most vulnerable populations access legal information, we can better assess the concept of open government with an eye toward informing and improving access to justice efforts.  Topics to be explored through readings and discussion include: 1) the adequacy of pro se litigants' access to legal information within the American prison system; 2) measuring the impact of U.S. states and municipalities that contract with private companies to publish public laws; 3) ways in which technology might help close the justice gap in low-income communities v. how technology can expose vulnerable communities to new forms of victimization; 4) creative and unique systems of information-sharing within the homeless population and how legal organizations might penetrate those systems to combat disenfranchisement of the homeless and provide them with broader access to legal services; and 5) the fragility of freedom of information laws in democracies and whether these laws contribute to a more informed public.

Whether as first-year law students or seasoned practitioners, the need to anticipate, appreciate, and reconcile religious perspectives is both a vital professional skill and an illuminating resource for self-understanding and mutual respect. The class will meet across three on-campus sessions and a closing offsite dinner, and will include a collaborative exploration of primary and secondary sources, as well as custom conversational frameworks. Topics will include religion and cross-cultural lawyering, religion and legal systems, the role of faith in judicial decision-making, and law as a vocation (with attendant self-care dynamics).

But the technologies we develop and deploy are shaped by historical prejudices, biases, and inequalities and thus are no less biased and racist than the underlying society in which they exist. In this discussion group, we will examine how racial and other biases are inherent in a wide range of technologies, including &quot;risk assessment&quot; algorithms for predictive policing or other decisions in the criminal justice system, facial recognition systems, surveillance tools, diagnostic algorithms for medical diagnosis and treatment decisions, &quot;digital redlining&quot; through housing ads, programs that determine entitlement to credit or public benefits and\/or purport to detect fraud by recipients, algorithms used in recruiting and hiring, digital divide access gaps, and more. Building on these various case studies, we will seek to articulate a framework for recognizing both explicit and subtle anti-black and other biases in tech and understanding them in the broader context of racism and inequality in our society. Finally, we will discuss how these problems might be addressed, including by regulators, legislators, and courts as well as by significant changes in mindset and practical engagement by technology developers and educators.

The laissez faire thinking of the 19th century was replaced by Keynesian management in response to the Great Depression. After WWII, Keynesian thinking was challenged, by 'neoliberalism'---a challenge that began to achieve success in the 1970s in response to perceived failures of government, high inflation, and other economic and social woes. By the mid-1980s, neoliberalism had become the new conventional wisdom, and liberals as well as conservatives accepted its core premises: that society consists of atomized individuals competing rationally to advance their own interests; that this behavior, in aggregate, produces good social outcomes and economic growth; that free markets are therefore the best way to allocate societal resources and government should intervene only to remedy market failures. Disagreements about what constitutes such failures and about corrective interventions persisted, but the general premises were widely embraced by policymakers and politicians. Today, that consensus is breaking down. Neoliberal policies and the particular systems of capitalism that accompany them have generated profound wealth inequality and have little to offer to address the perceived threats of globalization, climate change, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. The coronavirus pandemic has only served to highlight these and other problems.But what should come next?  Our readings in the course will explore a variety of themes related to these issues. How did neoliberalism come to dominate political discourse? What are its core tenets? What kinds of challenges are being presented to them, and what might alternative approaches to political economy for the 21st century look like?

Those interactions are rarely wholly happy, raising fundamental issues for plaintiffs about the definition of just desserts and fair procedure. There is a rich literature on these personal encounters, some autobiographical and others written by journalists who were given permission to closely follow victims' efforts to obtain compensation. These accounts paint a different picture of the tort liability regime than the one which 1Ls usually encounter in their Fall Torts course, which in recent decades have foregrounded a &quot;law &amp; economics&quot; perspective that focuses on deterring defendants rather than on satisfying victims' desires for justice. In each session we will read a book about an individual's or family's personal encounter with tort law. Candidate books for discussion include an autobiographical take on the author's experience suing doctors for malpractice after her husband's untimely death, a journalist's close account of a working class family's pursuit of compensation for the death of their infants, a holocaust victim's response to the outcome of a class action against Swiss Banks, a journalist's account of a community seeking compensation and accountability for toxic exposure from a pharmaceutical facility. We'll each read the selected book for the session and discuss what the account tells us about the operation of tort law (and civil procedure) in real life and what potential legal reforms it suggests, if any. Each session will be led by one or two students who volunteer (at the beginning of the quarter) to start off and guide the discussion. Writing requirement: One short (5 or so pages) reflection paper on one of the assigned books or another related book of your choice. If you choose to reflect on a different book, it should also be an account of laypersons' experiences with the tort liability system (not a doctrinal analysis of tort law).

And for many years it has been almost a clich&eacute; that we also have an internationally anomalously  high crime rate; crime gap between us and our &quot;peer nations&quot; has narrowed in recent years but is still remarkable, at least for violent crime. In the course we will read and an interdisciplinary set of explorations about whether there are things in &quot;national DNA&quot;  that explain each of these phenomena and possibly both at once.  The perspectives will include the political history of our roots in both revolution and slavery and the legacy of Reconstruction,  an d cultural\/anthropological theories about the &quot;frontier mentality,&quot;  as well as such distinct factors as our anomalous rate of gun ownership. Along all these dimensions we will speculate on which way the causation runs between crime or punishment and these various correlates.. But of course we will also look to the legal system, including our rights- and federalism-focused Constitution, as both cause and effect of our anomalies. While we will look at some more quantitively empirical  perspectives, especially as they bear on recent changes in both crime and punishment rates, our main subject will be more of an &quot;American Studies&quot; approach to the undeniable overall stability of how we compare to other nations.

Directed research credit may be awarded for work that expands on work initially assigned in, or conceived during, a course, clinic, or externship, but only if the continued work represents a meaningful and substantial contribution to the already existing project, significantly beyond mere editing or polishing.  If a student seeks to continue or expand on work that the student initiated previously (whether for a course, clinic, externship, or otherwise) a student must (1) share the initial work with the professor supervising the directed research, to the extent that work is non-privileged, and (2) obtain permission for the expansion from the instructor or supervisor who supervised the initial project.  The final product must be embodied in a paper or other form of written work involving a substantial independent effort on the part of the student.  A student must submit a detailed petition of at least 250 words, approved by the sponsoring faculty member, outlining his or her proposed project and demonstrating that the research is likely to result in a significant scholarly contribution.  A student may petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development&quot; when the work involves assisting a Law School faculty member in developing concepts or materials for new and innovative law school courses. Both the supervising faculty member and the Associate Dean for Curriculum must approve petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development.&quot; Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance.

Only projects supervised by a member of the faculty (tenured, tenure-track, senior lecturer, or professor from practice) may qualify for Directed Professional Writing credit.

The page length guidelines applicable to individual papers may be considered in determining the appropriate page length, but the faculty supervisor has discretion to make the final page-length determination.  Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance. Unit credit is by arrangement.  A petition will not be approved for work assigned or performed in a course, clinic, or externship for which the student has or will receive credit.

may necessitate adjustments of INTERPOL's policy and legal considerations in three broad areas: (1) online manifestations of support for extremist and terrorist conduct; (2) misinformation and fake new; (3) online incitement of violence and hatred, defamation, harassment, and cyber bullying. This Practicum aims to develop principles for INTERPOL to guide its interpretation and application of Article 3 to capture this new--online--manifestation of transnational crime. More specifically, it aims to establish general guidelines that INTERPOL can rely on in determining whether a request to process information on offenses arguably implicating freedom of expression online is in alignment with its constitutional obligation to remain neutral and adhere to international human rights standards.  This Practicum is open to graduate students from law (2L, 3L, and Advanced Degree), business, international policy, communications, computer science, and other relevant programs. Highly qualified undergraduates are also invited to apply. The practicum meets 9-10:30 on Wednesdays.

Justice By Design will examine how changes in the operation of housing courts are responding to the 'new normal' era of COVID-19, which has disproportionately affected communities of color.  Even before the pandemic, research showed that black and brown people, especially black women, face substantially higher eviction rates than other demographic groups. The economic hardships of the past year threaten to raise these rates even higher.  At the same time, there is a new openness to innovation in the courts, with virtual hearings, community navigators, and eviction diversion programs. The racial equity movement following the killing of George Floyd has also pushed court leaders to a moment of change and reflection. Many court justices and administrators have expressed an interest in making courts more accessible and equitable.  This class will use this opportunity to bring policymakers and judicial administrators together with community members -- especially from the demographic groups most likely to face eviction -- to improve how housing courts work, and to propose new initiatives to prevent evictions.  Students will work directly with the NAACP and other partner organizations, which are developing new models for eviction diversion and prevention. The research teams will tackle specific policy challenges, including how to broaden a community's awareness of rights and services; how court rules and procedures might be reformed to allow for meaningful participation; and adaptations in the format for hearings and mediations that enable equal access to all.  During the class, students will hear challenges from judicial leaders and housing advocates; conduct user research and design sessions with tenants and landlords; and propose new models of how landlord-tenant issues can be resolved in court hearings or diversion programs. A particular focus will be on programs that can work virtually, and on making these programs accessible and engaging for people from demographic groups most at risk of eviction. The final deliverable will be a proposed initiative for our partners to implement, along with an evaluation plan to measure its impact. It will include a written proposal and analysis, a visual presentation, and a public presentation to policy-makers around the country.  The students&iquest; learning goals are to understand how the housing and eviction system works, including the legal procedures, rights, and sociological dynamics of how this system interrelates with poverty and community stability. Students will also develop policy analysis and design skills grounded in qualitative and quantitative approaches. Students will expand their understanding of how to analyze complex social systems which will, in turn, contribute to new skills in facilitating discussions and collaborating with community members and policymakers to design new policy interventions and programs.  This policy lab invites applications from law students and from graduate and upper-class students across the university who are engaged in coursework focused on public policy and social problem solving, especially housing justice. Knowledge of the housing court system is beneficial but not required. The application is available at https:\/\/registrar.law.stanford.edu\/.

California recently passed SB 759, the &quot;Every Vote Counts Act,&quot; to codify requirements allowing voters a chance to fix their ballot in case of a signature mismatch. SB 759 requires elections officials notify voters of mismatched signatures at least 8 days prior to the certification of an election. Ballots would be counted by elections officials if a signature verification statement is returned no later than 5:00 p.m. two days prior to certification. However, the law does not specify in great detail the steps that counties should take to contact voters. Prior to the bill's passage, a report by the California Voter Foundation revealed substantial variation in how counties verified mismatched signatures and contacted affected voters. This Policy Lab research project will produce the first public report tracking how counties have implemented\/are planning to implement the requirements of SB 759. This project maps how the implementation of state statutes and guidelines dealing with vote-by-mail signature verification varies among California counties. Research questions for each county include: (1) What criteria does a signature need to meet to &quot;not appear to be the same&quot; (and therefore result in a ballot being invalidated)? (2) What remedial steps are taken, with regards to SB 759, if an election worker determines there is a &quot;signature mismatch&quot; before the statutory deadline? To answer these questions, students will conduct a survey of county election officials and administrative material and produce a final report with findings and lessons to improve county procedures. Students will research legal and policy frameworks, interview policy makers and state administrative officials, develop targeted policy recommendations, and brief policy makers on recommendations. The final report will be publicly available and will inform California county election officials, state policy-makers, and voting rights advocacy groups.  This policy practicum is offered for two to three variable units.  Students may elect three units by special arrangement with the instructors.

This is the winter quarter continuation of this practicum. We take as a given the well-established scientific evidence establishing the causal connection between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming, and the likelihood that current trajectories of fossil fuel use are leading to catastrophic climate change. In addition to its global consequences, climate change threatens to compromise Stanford's core missions through fires, environmental damage, and other harms to the University's staff, students, and faculty.  In the Autumn Quarter, in which the practicum was co-taught by Alicia Seiger, students undertook several research projects, including how Stanford researchers' broad-ranging expertise in energy-related finance issues could be most effectively deployed to inform policy makers; reducing food waste as a means of reducing GHG emissions; and Stanford health services' role in reducing GHG emissions.  In the Winter Quarter, we will focus on the possible effects on GHG emissions of investment policies and practices, automobile and air transportation, and the consumption of beef and other foods.  The mandate of Stanford Law and Policy Labs is to conduct impartial, evidence-informed policy analysis. Rather than deliver a set of specific recommendations, this practicum seeks to assess the pros and cons of plausible policies. While participants may have prior views on some of the issues, they should be open to revising their views in light of the evidence. Policy Lab practicums are research seminars. Although we will assign some readings and invite experts to meet with the seminar during the quarter, much of the research will be conducted by student teams. Policy Lab practicums are designed primarily for law students, but are open to students throughout the University. This practicum seeks students with knowledge of economics, finance, food systems, and environmental science. Admission is by petition.

Donors receive a tax deduction when they contribute money or appreciated assets to a DAF; at their discretion, donors (DAF &quot;holders&quot;) may advise the DAF manager, or &quot;sponsor,&quot; to distribute funds to tax-exempt charities. There are about 500,000 individual DAFs across the country, with total assets of over $100 billion. The major DAF sponsors are community foundations and the charitable arms of investment managers like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard. Although donors can only &quot;advise&quot; rather than &quot;direct&quot; a sponsor to make a gift, their advice is almost always heeded.  DAFs arguably incentivize giving by providing a vehicle for donating complex assets and reducing a donor's burdens by offloading administrative tasks to the DAF sponsor. Some DAF sponsors also offer advice to enable their DAF holders to give more effectively.  Yet DAFs have been criticized on several grounds, and legislation has been introduced (but not enacted) to regulate them. One criticism is that while donors receive the tax deduction immediately upon contributing to a DAF, they can take as long as they wish to make gifts from the DAF, and even pass advisory authority on to their heirs, thus delaying putting the funds into the hands of charities that can use them.  (In comparison, foundations are required to spend at least 5 percent of their assets annually.) Another criticism is that gifts made through a DAF can be anonymous, with only the DAF sponsor listed as the donor. (In comparison, gifts and grants by foundations must be reported on publicly available tax returns.) In addition, some DAF sponsors have concerns about requests to make gifts to putative hate groups: how to determine whether an organization falls in this category, and how to respond to the request if it does. At a time when the controversy around DAFs is only likely to grow, this Policy Lab practicum will provide an evidence-based analysis of the pros and cons of various self-reform and regulatory proposals. The research team will focus on understanding the perspectives of the recipients of DAF funding as well as those of DAF sponsors, DAF holders, regulators, and critics.

The Ferguson Report prepared by the United States Department of Justice identified a number of procedural due process violations in the way the city's municipal courts functioned.  These procedural defects amplified the consequences of racial disparities in who was arrested and charged in the city.  In the wake of the Ferguson Report, civil rights litigation has been brought challenging similar procedural due process violations in other municipal courts around the country.  Litigation has concentrated on excessive bail, fines, fees, and other court costs, conflicts of interests in having judges whose budgets depend on collection exercise discretion in setting these charges and collecting them, and failure to comply with Bearden v. Georgia (1983) (prohibiting imprisonment for failure to pay court charges without inquiring into a litigant's indigence and determining that a litigant's failure to pay is &quot;willful&quot;). This two-quarter sequence policy lab focuses on (i) gathering empirical, doctrinal, historical, and other research on municipal court practices associated with the setting, charging, and collection of court fines, fees, and other costs, including demographic research on vulnerable populations affected by procedural errors, (ii) gathering evidence regarding best practices to reform court procedures, particularly regarding compliance with Bearden v.

Most states and the federal government have adopted laws enhancing penalties for hate crimes, but questions remain as to the effectiveness of these laws in deterring hate violence and making victims whole.

Yet many of these alternative models, including restorative justice approaches, are undertheorized, rare in practice, and insufficiently assessed.  In conjunction with the Brennan Center for Justice, this policy lab assesses alternative approaches to hate crimes in theory and practice.  Students will work in collaborative teams to analyze existing research in fields including criminal law and criminology, identify innovative hate crimes programs established by nonprofit organizations or local governments, review outcomes related to restorative justice models, and prepare for an expert convening in the Winter term.

These proposed reforms are designed to accelerate innovation in the delivery of legal services, and increase access to justice, in part by allowing technology and people without JDs to play a greater role than they can today.  As states consider these reforms, there are many questions around the likely impact of these reforms on consumers and providers of legal services, and the most promising regulatory regime(s). Students will research and write about such questions as:  (1)  What are some of the most promising models from other industries for protecting consumers from harm, and providing redress? (2)  What might an independent regulator that oversees entities that provide legal services look like? (3)  What are the most promising innovations in states that have experimented with non- lawyer providers and other access to justice initiatives. (4) What lessons can we learn from other contexts, including other countries and other professions (for example the medical context, where nurse practitioners can provide services directly, and people other than physicians can own entities that provide health care)?  The client will be one or more of the following non-profits working on these issues: the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System, National Center on State Courts, or Responsive Law.  The deliverables will be a set of policy briefs and talking points that will inform the regulatory reform debate.  Students from a range of disciplines are very welcome, including undergraduates interested in public policy.

This policy lab will engage with challenging legal, social, government systems, and technological questions, with opportunities to design and\/or implement new tools to aid in the reentry process. We will work with a variety of stakeholders including government organizations and programs, non-profit entities, and legal innovators to prototype and evaluate new technological solutions to facilitate the reentry process and reduce recidivism.  This practicum will build a collaborative team of diverse backgrounds and skill sets to learn from each other and enhance the overall capacity of the research and tool development.

From cans of tuna to shrimp cocktail, the legality of how seafood is caught and processed is often uncertain.  This policy lab confronts the global environmental and human rights challenges associated with the existing framework of international laws and policies. The research delves into international laws that apply to the high seas, illegal fishing, supply chains, forced labor and human rights abuses to locate leverage points and explore innovative solutions, including how new technologies might be developed and deployed. The research contributes to a work of The Friends of Ocean Action -- convened by the World Economic Forum -- a coalition of public sector, private sector, and civil society leaders who are committed to accelerating action for sustainability. Solutions require cooperation among nations, international seafood companies, and nonprofit organizations, and the containment of rogue actors.  In this policy lab, students will work with two clients. On illegal fishing, the client is Global Fishing Watch.  Created through a collaboration among Google and other partners, Global Fishing Watch is a pioneer in harnessing satellite technology to enable better management of fisheries. On forced labor, the client is the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, which brings together tuna processors who comprise more than 70% of the global market for canned tuna and is committed to developing solutions to address forced labor on fishing vessels in the tuna sector and beyond.  Through the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions, students will also connect to a broad range of additional actors on these issues, including UN agencies, large seafood companies, and human rights and environmental NGOs. Students will produce policy briefs that will be published by the Center for Ocean Solutions. The practicum seeks law students, business students, and graduate and well-qualified undergraduates in such programs as earth systems, computer science, product design, public policy, sociology, and marine biology.

China is investing in massive foreign-infrastructure construction, notably in emerging economies. Whether that infrastructure is high-carbon or low-carbon will largely determine the future of climate change. Many universities and institutions are studying the carbon impacts of China's foreign-infrastructure investment. That research tends to compare China's aggregate fossil-fuel-versus-renewable investments, assessing whether those investments meet a clean-energy ideal. New research at Stanford's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance is undertaking this analysis differently. It seeks to map the players and financial flows of global infrastructure investment in a way that compares the carbon intensity of Chinese-financed infrastructure projects in important emerging economies with the carbon intensity of energy infrastructure in those countries that has been financed by multilateral, bilateral, and other non-Chinese entities. This method is designed to reflect the way global infrastructure funding works, politically and economically, in actual practice -- and thus to elucidate particularly realistic ways to meaningfully decarbonize Chinese infrastructure financing.  In this policy lab, which is the second phase of the spring 2020 lab, students will advance research toward two sorts of deliverables: a data-analysis and data-visualization tool to map players, financing structures, and carbon emissions from Chinese-financed infrastructure projects in key host countries; and a written account of how Chinese-financed infrastructure is playing out in those countries. The research will involve close interaction with key officials at key infrastructure-financing institutions in China and around the world. Graduate students from across Stanford are invited to apply. Data-analysis skills, energy-finance understanding, and proficiency in Mandarin are useful skills for this work, but they are not required.  The lab seeks graduate students from the disciplines of law, business, engineering and environmental science, and East Asian Studies.

Government agencies are complex institutions, performing diverse and vital functions and employing a wide variety of types of employees, some of whom are represented by labor bargaining units.  They handle and manage information subject to privacy protections, and many of the communications engaged in between employees and with members of the public are also subject to public disclosure requirements.  Public agencies also face financial, technological, and personnel resource limitations.  California state agencies need to be able to anticipate work and access issues due to its experiences with natural and manmade disasters, frequently in the form of earthquakes and fires.  The disruptions created by this  pandemic, because of its impacts on the workforce and economy, are extreme but highlight the need for broad reconsideration of work functions, locations, and worker support.  The Project:  Working with one state agency, the California State Controller's Office (SCO), students will research and evaluate best practices for remote work by government employees and develop recommendations to ensure the critical government functions continue during a variety of disasters and emergencies.  Students will also try to learn what remote work policies could be effectively implemented over the long term.  After gaining an understanding of the key functions of the State Controller's Office, students will research and provide answers to several critical questions, which may include:  What are legally required timelines for performance of key tasks and functions and how do these requirements implicate remote work?  What are the best practices related to chain of command, communications, and redundancy protocols to ensure ongoing operations?  How can remote work policies ensure that decision-making remains efficient and effective?  What are the priority factors to analyze when determining which staff positions should be designated &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;non-essential&quot;?  In the current coronavirus environment, how does this analysis implicate who can or should be physically onsite?  What are the processes that are required to be in place should an employee whose work is designated essential have a person who is at risk at home?  What are the implications for public employees related to FLSA, OSHA, and Workers' Compensation Insurance compliance?  How have business, other government agencies, and nonprofits resolved these issues and what are their best practices?  How can those practices be implemented within the SCO?  What are the technology requirements that can effectuate remote work?  What types of encryption are necessary to protect private and sensitive data?  If workers are using their privately-owned technology (e.g., cellular phones, computers), what are the possible exposures due to public records act reporting requirements and in a litigation setting?  What are the equity implications of operationalizing remote work policies?  What are the demographics of the positions with functions that can and cannot most likely take advantage of remote work?  What are implications for the worker experience of remote work in different demographic groups?  What are the impacts of differential levels of access to adequate technology at home?  What is a cost-benefit analysis of shifting to more remote work?  Are there cost-savings through potential reduction of work force or physical space?  If so, what are the equity implications?  What are the environmental benefits of shifting to remote work?  Student Skills and Interests:  All students are welcome regardless of experience as long as you are interested in this topic.

And yet, the international community is increasingly divided when it comes to advancing the project of international justice. Whereas earlier armed conflicts have inspired the establishment of international or hybrid tribunals (such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) or were referred to the International Criminal Court (such as the situations in Darfur and Libya), a pervasive tribunal fatigue and other geopolitical impasses have greeted today's armed conflicts and repressive regimes. The U.N. Security Council in particular has been hamstrung by the propensity of Russia, sometimes with China in tow, to veto (or threaten to veto) robust accountability proposals that have been put forward. States have been able to reach consensus only around the imperative of prosecuting terrorism and members of the so-called Islamic State, including foreign fighters.  As a result of these obstacles, advocates and their sovereign allies have looked to other organs and institutions within and without the United Nations to respond to the commission of international crimes. The General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, and even the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have thus all become engines of accountability, in part because they are not subject to the pernicious veto. In addition, civil society actors (such as the Commission on International Justice &amp; Accountability and the Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organization) have stepped up to undertake investigative functions that would ordinarily be performed by sovereign states or international prosecutors. A number of human rights law firms--such as the Center for Justice &amp; Accountability and Accountability Counsel--are continuing to seek justice in U.S. courts and other fora under a suite of statutes that allow for civil redress for international law violations. And, a new breed of CS-for-Good organizations--such as Benetech and Hala Systems--are developing new technology tools to undergird accountability efforts, but need assistance with understanding the operative legal framework and evidentiary standards.  This proposed lab will support several of these institutions in their effort to move justice processes forward. On the multilateral plane, confirmed partners\/clients include the International Impartial Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM), established by the U.N. General Assembly; the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh\/ISIL (UNITAD), established by the Security Council; and the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), established by the U.N. Human Rights Council.  Domestically, the U.S. State Department's Office of Global Criminal Justice has the lead on the United States' transitional justice policy around the globe. It is increasingly beleaguered within the Department and the interagency as it attempts to advance U.S. support for human rights and accountability in the face of significant resistance. In addition, a number of civil society and non-governmental organizations are conducting thorough criminal investigations and forming detailed dossiers on potential perpetrators in an effort to jumpstart national proceedings, including those proceeding under extraordinary bases of jurisdiction; lay the groundwork for international prosecutions when--and if--an opening appears; and support multilateral and unilateral sanctions regimes, such as the United States' Global Magnitsky Act. Closer to home, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are working with Black Lives Matter and other organizations to utilize United Nations and human rights treaty institutions to raise awareness about police violence and structural racism in the United States.  This policy lab will be open to law students in the Fall and Winter quarters during academic year 2020-21. The application process will coincide with the Mills Legal Clinic registration process. Students can enroll in 3-6 units and receive Pathway B Experiential Learning credit towards graduation.  Students enrolled in the lab will conduct both factual and legal research on behalf of partner organizations, participate in advocacy efforts aimed at advancing the imperative of accountability for grave international crimes, and generate concrete policy proposals for building a more robust international justice architecture. Work in the lab will expose students to a range of experiential learning opportunities to build and hone the following human rights lawyering and advocacy skills:  1.  Interfacing (orally and in writing) with a range of influential civil society, governmental, and multilateral actors;  2.  Assisting these organizations with strategic planning, problem solving, diplomatic outreach, and advocacy;  3.  Conducting open source investigations on emergent atrocity situations around the world as well as historical events subject to contemporary accountability processes;  4.  Conducting trauma-informed interviews with survivors;  5.  Recognizing and helping to resolve ethical dilemmas that arise in a human rights practice (such as the tension between fealty to a client and advancing the movement);  6.  Refining the information gathered for a range of transitional justice purposes;  7.  Conducting traditional legal research and writing projects, including for briefs, human rights reports, proto-indictments, expert reports, and petitions to international human rights bodies; and  8.  Practicing project and peer management and other professional skills.  Along the way, students will be closely supervised and will receive constant, and stereoscopic, feedback from the instructor as well as from peers and mentors recruited from partner organizations.  In addition to this client-facing work, the weekly seminar component of the lab will involve doctrinal instruction in the global human rights ecosystem, including human rights treaties (such as the International Convention on Civil &amp; Political Rights), human rights institutions (such as the Committee Against Torture), international courts (such as the International Criminal Court), and U.N. mandate holders (such as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention). Students will also have the opportunity to engage in a number of simulations and role plays to practice their human rights reasoning and lawyering skills. In addition to producing work product for clients and partner organizations, students will compose a series of reflection papers over the course of the quarter to capture their experience of developing their professional identity as a human rights lawyer\/advocate. This integrated learning environment--which touches upon cognitive, practical, and ethical-social competencies--will enable student lawyers to wed their concrete experience with more abstract theory. Students will be graded on their participation and performance, their written work product, and their commitment to developing their professional skills (with partner organizations, clients, other stakeholders, and each other).

Ensuring the privacy rights of residents and technology users in California remains a core responsibility of legislators and regulators in the state. Recent state legislation such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), coupled with the state Attorney General's Office implementing regulations, have aimed to provide an expanded range of privacy and consumer protections, and an upcoming, follow-on ballot initiative may further alter the state regulatory landscape. But these efforts are imperfect and incomplete and have been subject to vigorous debate and criticism over both the details of their approach and their ultimate efficacy.  Privacy risks can arise from the collection, aggregation, sharing, and use of data by both governments and private businesses and other private actors, and from lack of transparency of and accountability for such actions. This policy lab will explore the role that cities such as Berkeley can play in furthering efforts to protect privacy against government and private actions, including government acquisition and use of data that is initially collected and aggregated by private entities. We will work with the Office of the Vice-Mayor of Berkeley to engage questions surrounding the nature and scope of the authority held by California Charter Cities like Berkeley to exercise local control and enact legislation to address municipal affairs that include the privacy of their local residents and businesses. The lab will examine the range of powers and regulatory tools available to city governments that might be utilized for privacy protection as part of overall municipal responsibility to protect the health and safety of residents.  Part of our focus will be to research and assess approaches from government entities around California and the rest of the country. Students will work with the vice-mayor and may also interview and consult other relevant stakeholders in Berkeley city government and other government entities, relevant privacy experts, community and consumer groups, businesses, and other interested stakeholders as appropriate. Ultimately, we will evaluate best practices and develop recommendations for possible local privacy and related consumer-protection legislation and regulation that is appropriately tailored to safeguard innovation and competition while ensuring that the best interests of local residents and businesses are served, particularly in situations where a city may be particularly well-positioned or have particularly appropriate tools to address privacy concerns.  We encourage students who are interested in complex issues of privacy and consumer protection, and in helping identify and develop novel, alternative avenues for enhancing such protection, such as using the the authority of local governments, to join us, including upper-division and graduate students from law, MS&amp;E, public policy, and the social sciences.

The research will entail the following methodological steps:  1.  Requesting the list of women serving current sentences for homicide from each state department of correction.  2.  Sending women serving current sentences for homicide a two-page survey asking questions about the circumstances of their current offense(s) and relevant intimate partner violence. Asking women to complete the survey and return it in a self-addressed stamped envelope. Assuring women that their responses will be kept confidential and giving them the choice to complete them anonymously.  3.  Analyzing and aggregating responses from returned surveys.  4.  Comparing results with data received from the National Violent Death Reporting System maintained by the Center for Disease Control and Intimate Partner Violence data collected by state departments of health. In addition, relying on court records and local press coverage to complement the results.  5.  Publishing results in academic journals and policy reports.  Collecting and making this data available will shed important light on the nature of the female correctional population, the largest growing segment of the U.S. prison population, and might guide policy discussions on charging, sentencing, prison programming, parole and reentry policies and decisions. The results may also inform laws regarding self-defense and other affirmative defenses, and strategies for addressing domestic violence.

As a result of COVID-19, most jurisdictions in the country rapidly moved court and court-related communications from in-person to audio- and video-conferencing. Providers of indigent defense services have identified concerns associated with this move, including the effect it has on attorney-client relationships and confidentiality and the ability of clients to access reliable technology. In partnership with National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and with the involvement of Stanford Sociology Professor Matthew Clair, the Stanford Criminal Justice Center is conducting a study on the uses, dynamics and effects of remote technology at different stages of criminal proceedings in light of COVID-19. The project will entail both a national survey (survey will be sent out nationally during August 2020 and students will analyze results) and in-depth interviews with a range of stakeholders in a handful of jurisdictions to assess how technology is being used and develop best practice for the delivery of indigent defense services during and after the pandemic.

The administrative challenges local officials are confronting in the 2020 election are unprecedented in U.S. history. As the primary elections reveal, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens our democracy as much as it threatens public health. Jurisdictions around the country are scrambling to deal with massive shifts to mail balloting, polling place closures, and loss of poll workers.  Students in this policy lab will investigate the measures state and local officials are taking to protect their elections from the effect of the pandemic.  Students will research, write and\/or update policy memos on election preparedness in battleground states, work with our partners to recruit poll workers to reduce the risk of polling place closures due to poll worker shortages, prepare materials for voter outreach and education, and help ensure polling place safety. After the election, students will assess the success of various aspects of the administration of the election, and, in the winter term, produce a detailed post-mortem group report. All students will produce team-based policy memos and internal presentations to be integrated into the final report.  This policy lab will continue over two quarters with a small subset of students from the fall term selected to join the winter research team. The winter quarter will focus on finalizing the research and work product initiated in the fall term.  Students from all disciplines are welcome to apply (including undergraduates). However, preference will be given to current team members of the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project and those with experience in election law and policy. We especially welcome applications from students in the law, public policy, political science, and design disciplines, and from those with strong writing and editing skills.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units (Section 02), depending on paper length.  The Fall term class meets remotely each week on Wednesdays, 4:15-6:15 p.m. Winter term TBD.

Deliverables: Policy memos, briefing presentation, final policy report.  The Clean Water Act is the premier law protecting the waterways of the United States.  Yet based on facility self-reports, 29% of permitted facilities under CWA were in &quot;significant non-compliance&quot; (SNC) in 2018: that is, close to a third of all facilities either discharged substantially above their permit limits or otherwise failed to meet their permit obligations. Such pollution has serious consequences for the health and well-being of millions of Americans.  One of the Environmental Protection Agency's ambitious national compliance initiatives aims to cut the SNC rate in half by 2022. To that end, EPA is hoping to research, compile, and disseminate information about the most innovative interventions that have been piloted and implemented by states, EPA regions, and federal EPA.  This policy practicum will assist the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance to develop this &quot;Best Practices&quot; Compendium.  Professors Dan Ho and Deborah Sivas will lead a team of students, in close coordination with the EPA team, to develop the compendium. The work will entail (a) conducting interviews of state, regional, and federal environmental regulators (most of which have been pre-identified by EPA), (b) drafting short case studies of each practice (e.g., early warning letters, technical assistance, simplified disclosures), (c) assessing benefits, costs, and evidence underpinning these practices, and (d) helping EPA disseminate this information.  The learning objectives include: (i) a deeper understanding of the nation's principal regulatory framework to protect water, (ii) engaging with officials to learn and compile best practices, and (iii) developing a strong sense of environmental law and regulatory enforcement in action, including the promise and constraints of the behavioral and enforcement toolkit.  This is a two-quarter policy practicum, which will be run virtually, for the fall and winter quarters. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in both quarters. Those who (a) have a strong interest or background in environmental law, administrative law, regulatory enforcement, or policy-oriented research, and (b) are able to enroll in both fall and winter terms will be given priority. R credit is available for students who extend the work into a significant research component.

In particular, we will consider proposals to shift mental health response, school discipline, traffic enforcement, and homeless services away from armed, uniformed officers. What kinds of agencies should shoulder these responsibilities?  How should the transfer be accomplished?  We will also ask how these policy changes relate to, complement, or compete with other possible approaches to police reform and the transformation of public safety. Should such changes be part of an overall effort to shrink the footprint of police departments, to change the nature of what police departments do, or both? How, if at all, should changes in police budgets be used to drive reform?  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

Deliverables: Resources for national DEI database for law schools, final summary report.  Law schools, other professional schools, and institutions of higher education all around the country have been reevaluating their structure, mission, curricula, pedagogy, hiring and admissions practices, climate, and other elements of academic life with the goal of ascertaining how best to promote a more just, fair, inclusive, and diverse environment for learning.  Students, staff, administrators, and faculty have created listservs and other informal platforms to share ideas and resources, but to date there has been no single research-based platform that gathers cutting edge and canonical work on the wide range of potentially relevant topics to guide and provide structure to the design of reforms or support advocacy on DE&amp;I issues.  Stanford Law School and the Robert Crown Library have launched a beta version of the first national clearinghouse to index research of this kind.  This policy lab provides interested students an opportunity to expand the index, help develop and implement standards for curation, incorporate feedback from users, engage in policy discussions about iterative design, and develop frameworks for assessment of the project.  The primary work plan involves deepening the available research on a number of topics including: 1L and advanced doctrinal pedagogy, critical race theory, other critical approaches to law, cultural competence and cultural humility in training for law and other service professions, professional judgment, assessments of DE&amp;I training in the private and public sector, published templates for university DE&amp;I reforms, principles of academic freedom, global innovations in DE&amp;I theory, as well as interdisciplinary research on anti-racism, implicit bias and other forms of cognitive bias, viewpoint discrimination, micro-aggression, trauma, and stereotype threat.  Students will work with Prof. Norman W. Spaulding and reference librarians at the law school. There may also be opportunity to work with students, staff, administrators, and faculty at other law schools and other university departments.

The productive interplay between federal government, research universities, and private enterprise has given rise to an American innovation engine that is the envy of the world. But with respect to artificial intelligence, the American research prowess that's powered decades of growth and prosperity is at risk. There are two reasons: public researchers' lack of access to compute power and the scarcity of meaningful datasets, the two prerequisites for advanced AI research.  To address this problem, in 2020 the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) issued a call for the government to create a National Research Cloud (NRC), a close partnership between academia, government, and industry to provide academic researchers with affordable access to high-end computational resources, to large-scale government-held datasets in a secure cloud environment, and to the necessary expertise to benefit from this resource. Congress has responded to this call with its proposed National AI Research Resource Task Force Act of 2020.  Investigating possible ways to implement the NRC according to the proposed legislation, the practicum research team will work closely with scholars at HAI to (1) propose ways to power the NRC with rich and easily-usable datasets while complying with important legal issues such as data privacy; and (2) recommend the proper level of government involvement in building and administering the NRC. The research team will draw from student expertise and familiarity with law, computer science, engineering, economics, and other interdisciplinary fields. Student researchers will conduct interviews with private sector tech companies, public sector administrative officials, and academic researchers. Students will also research adjacent federal policies and agencies that seek to stimulate innovation through similar or other means.  This practicum will run winter and spring terms with preference for students who can enroll for both quarters. The project seeks students with law, engineering, computer science, economic, and policy backgrounds.

In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and calls for police reform, the United States is in the midst of a national reckoning that is forcing us to confront systemic racism and the institutions that perpetuate anti-Black racism, white supremacy, and discrimination against Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.  Perhaps no institution has reproduced racial hierarchy in the U.S. more than our public education system. From state-sponsored racial segregation of schools to the more subtle, but no less insidious racially segregated academic placements (e.g., special education, advanced placement) to exclusionary school discipline policies to ostensibly &quot;meritocratic&quot; testing and grading policies and beyond, public schools have created and perpetuated racial hierarchy, despite the promise that schools should help all children achieve the American Dream. The Lab aims to critically analyze the structural racism in our schools and asks the question: What would an anti-racist public education look like?  Specifically, partnering with Public Counsel and IntegrateNYC, the Youth Justice Lab will explore the history, current landscape, and racialized consequences of: (1) the educational caste system created by student assignment to various public schools, including selective schools, traditional schools, continuation and alternative schools, and court schools and (2) high-stakes standardized testing for student placement and assignment purposes. (Other topics may be covered, depending on client need and resource availability.) With that research in mind, the Lab will work with experts to develop specific policy and research interventions that aim to dismantle the systemic racism and interlocking oppressions built into those educational policies and practices. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to these issues by enrolling students from the Law School and the Graduate School of Education. Students in the Lab will gather and analyze the relevant historical and empirical research, interview and consult with experts in the field, and draft a series of research and policy memos that summarize our research and provide recommendations.

This is true of criminal law policies that use algorithmic predictions of flight before trial; environmental policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and conventional pollutants; and social and health policies that address homelessness, institutional racism, and the distribution of Covid vaccines, to name just a few examples. The causes of the problems that these policies seek to address are complex. Social and environmental policies often fail and sometimes have unintended adverse consequences.  &quot;Systems thinking&quot; is a framework that describes the web of associations in which such policies reside, with the goals of understanding the multiple causes of problems and designing policies that lead to stable, positive changes. Systems thinking and how to engage in systems change are core skills for policy makers.  The goal of this Policy Lab is to create an online course that illustrates the main concepts of systems thinking (including stocks and flows, balancing and reinforcing loops, and systems archetypes) and systems change using real-world case studies. In the process, students in the Policy Lab will themselves acquire an understanding of these concepts and learn how to use the web-based systems mapping tool, Kumu.  While there are no prerequisites for enrollment in the Policy Lab, students, whether or not in the Law School, with knowledge or strong interests in legal, environmental, social, and health policies are welcomed.

In recent years, a large fraction of U.S. employers -- including many leading law firms -- have required their employees to sign contracts containing mandatory arbitration clauses and &quot;non-disclosure agreements&quot; (NDAs). Available research suggests that more than 60 million American workers are bound by these arbitration clauses, which require employees who have any type of legal claim arising out of their work or workplace to waive their right to trial and resolve their claims, on an individual basis, in private arbitration. Traditionally, arbitration takes place behind closed doors, and the details of the employee's claim (and employer's response), any evidence presented to the arbitrators, the proceedings themselves and the ultimate outcome are confidential. Moreover, employees who are offered monetary settlements to resolve their arbitration claims -- or lawsuits, for those who were not compelled to arbitrate under a contractual provision -- are typically required to sign NDAs as a condition of receiving compensation. As a result of arbitration and NDAs, information about wrong-doing in the workplace -- even egregious wrong-doing -- never becomes public, arguably diminishing the ability of the legal system to deter harmful behavior. Moreover, with claims resolved individually, in private, and settlements protected by NDAs, it is impossible to detect a pattern of wrongful behavior and to hold wrongdoers to account in the public square. These consequences seem particularly problematic in claims arising from gender discrimination, particularly sexual harassment. Secrecy also prevents us from discovering whether women of color or low-income women of all colors are particularly disadvantaged by mandatory arbitration and NDAs.  The expanding use of mandatory arbitration and NDAs in employment claims has evoked considerable controversy and legislation has been introduced at both the national and state levels to prohibit the inclusion of these clauses in employment contracts. However, the legislation has yet to move forward on the national level and whether state statutes will withstand challenge is currently unclear. Moreover, there is little systematic evidence of the consequences of mandatory arbitration and NDAs, leaving both supporters and opponents to rely on anecdotes. There is little hard information on the numbers of employees covered by arbitration contracts or how this varies by industry sector and employee gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic characteristics.  Importantly we do not know how the existence of these contracts affects men and women's willingness to bring their claims to their employers' attention or how claiming varies by race, ethnicity or employee status. Nor do we know how pursuing claims for gender discrimination, including sexual harassment, affects claimants' future career trajectories.  The Client for this policy lab, Lift Our Voices, was co-founded by women's rights advocates and broadcast journalists Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky. Ms. Carlson's sexual harassment suit against powerful former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes helped pave the way for the #metoo movement. Roginsky left Fox after settling a lawsuit for sexual harassment and discrimination against Fox News, its former co-president Bill Shine and Ailes. To learn more about Lift Our Voices, go to https:\/\/www.liftourvoices.org\/.  The goal of this practicum is to produce objective empirical evidence -- both quantitative and qualitative -- that can be used in Life Our Voices and others' advocacy activities regarding mandatory arbitration and NDAs, including advocacy -- if the data support this -- that argues in favor of restricting or precluding mandatory arbitration and NDAs in some or all circumstances.  Students in the practicum will meet with the co-founders of Lift Our Voices to identify the questions for which empirical evidence would be most useful for policy reform advocacy. We will learn from Mss. Carlson and Roginsky what information has proved most useful to date and what current gaps in evidence are most significant, from a policy perspective. We will also meet with employer representatives and lawyers both for plaintiffs and defendants to explore their perspectives on the merits and demerits of mandatory arbitration and NDAs for resolving workplace claims, especially claims of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Information from arbitration proponents may suggest how to craft policy reform proposals that have an optimal chance of being adopted.  Students will:  1  conduct research on recent and ongoing legislative efforts to curb or eliminate the use of mandatory arbitration and NDAs;  2.  review previous empirical research on the prevalence and consequences of mandatory arbitration and NDAs for workplace disputes;  3.  Interview stakeholders, including civil rights advocates, particularly but not limited to women's rights advocates; other employee advocates; employer representatives; representatives of arbitration provider institutions and legislative staffers who have been working on this policy topic;  4.  Collect and analyze available quantitative data on the extent of use of arbitration for workplace disputes and information on outcomes, if available;  5.  When possible, conduct confidential interviews with employees who have suffered discrimination or harassment to learn about their concerns about bringing claims against employers and\/or their career experiences after bringing such claims.  The research will be conducted collaboratively by student teams who will co-author reports of their findings. Specific research and writing assignments will be developed as the quarter progresses. This project will likely run for two quarters, with the first quarter devoted mainly to research and the second to analyzing the findings, writing policy briefs and research papers (for R credit, where appropriate).  Students approved for R-credit (Section 02) will be graded on the H\/P\/R\/F grading basis.  Students need not commit to continuing on for a second quarter, and new students who will continue the work of the first quarter's students will be accepted in the second quarter.

Wildfire smoke has emerged as one of the most pressing air pollution and public health threats in the Western United States. Last year, despite decades of progress in reducing air pollution from transport, industry, and electric power, wildfires caused the highest number of &quot;spare the air&quot; declarations ever called by local Air Quality Management Districts in California. Oregon, Washington and Colorado all suffered similar &quot;airpocalypse&quot; fire seasons. Recent model-based estimates of mortality from wildfire smoke-derived particulate matter suggest that between 1200 and 3000 seniors likely died from the fires this summer. Current law and regulation not only doesn't consider particulate matter derived from wildfire smoke to be a target for regulation, it also imposes burdensome permitting requirements on one of the most effective risk-mitigation strategies: prescribed fire.  In this course, we will both learn about the science and regulatory framework governing smoke and develop new research and briefing materials for the California legislature and executive branches focused on informing a new approach. The course is intended for students interested in multi-disciplinary approaches to public policy problems. No background in either the Clean Air Act or wildfire policy is required. Students will work in multi-disciplinary teams focused on current policy problems including (1) mapping policies regarding prescribed fire at local Air Quality Management Districts; (2) developing a policy proposal to facilitate coordinated permitting of much greater prescribed fire under the Clean Air Act; and (3) deploying a simplified air quality health benefits model (EPA COBRA) to estimate the potential public health and economic benefits of better fuels management.  Students will engage in a once per week lecture\/discussion of wildfire smoke science and policy, including student presentations. Class will also meet additionally once per week in a working session to discuss progress on team projects. Students will be expected to present the results of their team projects to California legislative and executive branch staff engaged in developing new approaches to wildfire policy.

The first project involves an important development in the movement for law enforcement officials, particularly prosecutors, to use their authority and discretion to advance &quot;progressive&quot; reform, usually involving reducing reliance on incarceration. The policy lab will support Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon, who was recently elected on a platform to run and reform the largest prosecution office in the country. In particular, students will assist the DA's office in designing and developing a Resentencing Unit within the office to revisit old sentences imposed under prior DA administrations that are longer than those called for under DA Gascon's current practices. Gascon's office estimates that up to 20,000 people may qualify for resentencing consideration by the Resentencing Unit. Students will help develop systems to identify and prioritize people who are currently incarcerated and who may qualify for resentencing consideration. Students will work in small teams to research individual cases and draft memoranda for the DA's office. (Information on the DA's Resentencing Unit is available here:  https:\/\/da.lacounty.gov\/policies\/resentencing-FAQ.).  The second project supports the California Committee on the Revision of the Penal Code, which is a new state organization tasked with studying California's criminal law and making reform recommendations to the Governor and Legislature. The Committee will hold six public meetings this year on subjects including the death penalty, life without parole, Three Strikes, juvenile justice, and mental health. Students will work closely with Committee members and staff to help set specific agenda for the public meetings. The work product includes research and reform recommendation memoranda for Committee members, other state legislators, and the office of Governor Gavin Newsom. (Information on the Committee is available here: http:\/\/clrc.ca.gov\/CRPC.html.).

Client: Innovate Alabama, https:\/\/innovatealabama.org\/.  The newly established Alabama Innovation Commission, known as Innovate Alabama, has sought policy recommendations from a group of faculty at Stanford University, including representatives from Stanford Law School and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The goal of the Alabama Innovation Commission is to identify and present to policymakers policies that will promote innovation, entrepreneurship, economic development, and high-skilled jobs in the state. In this policy lab, students will work on papers whose results will be incorporated with attribution into the recommendations provided to the Commission and the Governor. Where possible, projects will be conducted in partnership with students at the major research universities in Alabama. Available topics for projects include building on the state's existing competencies in medical research and space and defense technology; assessing financial incentives for attracting businesses; deploying broadband-based education; fostering the role of universities in economic development; and drawing high-skilled workers through opportunities for outdoor recreation.  Students admitted to the lab will work on one of the following projects (to be determined according to the priorities of the client):  1.) Business Incentives and Prosperity. High profile competitions for the headquarters of large corporations often lead states to offer large incentive packages. States that land the deal are often perceived as the winners. Some recruitment initiatives indeed bring substantial local economic benefits, yet recent research has called into question many commonly-held beliefs about state incentives. Such incentives often may have costs that exceed benefits, and there is some question even as to whether they increase local economic activity at the margin in most cases. This project will evaluate Alabama's existing incentives for attracting businesses and make recommendations based on the successes and failures of recent incentive programs around the country. The project will weigh the potential for traditional recruitment tactics such as tax incentives and subsidized industrial sites against alternatives such as infrastructure development, skills development programs, and customized business services. (S. Haber and J. Rauh).  2.) Deploying Broadband-Based Education. The future of Alabama rests on the talent and knowledge of its citizens so the success of K-12 public education must be a potent driver of human capital development.  The work of the Stanford-AL team will look at the current and potential for deploying broadband-based education throughout the state to augment the current capacities of K-12 educators to deliver high quality instruction, especially in the priority areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) which ties in closely to economic development plans for the state. (M. Raymond).  3.) Fostering the Role of Universities. It is widely recognized that universities are key to the development of innovative economic activity at the state and local level. The most productive local innovation economies in the US have emerged in locations such as Silicon Valley, North Carolina's Research Triangle, and the Boston area, powered by research that has emerged from local universities. Success stories of the impact of universities on the innovative ecosystem also abound in smaller markets in recent decades. This project will aim to make specific, concrete recommendations for state government policy to build on the strength of Alabama's universities to grow Alabama's technology and innovation economy. (R. Banks and J. Rauh).  4.) The Outdoor Recreation Lab. Persuading someone to move thousands of miles to a new home, a new community, and a new state is not an event; it is a process. It often starts with a short visit that plants a seed in a person's mind. Those crucial, initial, short visits often occur because of tourism; and when it comes to people who have invested in human capital that is specific to high technology industries, that tourism tends to be focused on outdoor recreation. Outdoor recreation tourism is not, however, simply a way to draw high-skilled workers into a state; it is also a way to share the economic rents generated by high tech industries with rural areas. It is the working hypothesis of the Outdoor Recreation Lab that Alabama's Cumberland Plateau has necessary environmental characteristics to be a draw for high tech workers and entrepreneurs\/and thus be an important part of building and sustaining a more innovative Alabama economy--but that potential has not been fully developed. The purpose of the Outdoor Recreation Lab is to assess the hypothesis that the Cumberland Plateau is an underdeveloped resource for the State of Alabama. Specifically, the lab will assess its natural endowments as compared to its physical and business infrastructure. An important component of this assessment is the extent of public lands, the interpretation of &quot;public trust&quot; in Alabama law regarding access to navigable rivers and streams, and the number and identity of agencies that would have to be coordinated to provide access to those lands and waterways.  It will also learn about the attempts--both successful and not--by other states to leverage natural endowments to generate in-migration by tech workers and entrepreneurs. (S. Haber).  Additional sub-projects if students are interested may include deep dives into how Alabama can build on existing competencies in Medical Research and in Space\/Defense technology to foster the further development of its economy and technology center.  The lab seeks students from the law and business schools, the graduate MS&amp;E program, and other graduate students with a background in entrepreneurship and\/or local governance.

Standards for approval of a SCEP placement are similar to those for Directed Research proposals, although they are higher. Because there is a preference for local civil and criminal SEP placements (see Law 882 and Law 883), your SCEP proposal must explain (a) how it meets the goals of the externship program; and (b) why a similar project cannot be accomplished in one of the placements offered in the Bay Area. SCEP placements outside the Bay Area must be full-time. Students wishing to undertake a SCEP placement obtain the supervision of a faculty member who will oversee their externship and an accompanying tutorial. For a full description of the SCEP, students should read the Externship Handbook, which is available from the Levin Center for Public Service and Public Interest Law or online at: http:\/\/www.law.stanford.edu\/organizations\/programs-and-centers\/john-and-terry-levin-center-for-public-service-and-public-interest-law\/externship-program-0. Students wishing to enroll in an externship must meet the various requirements that are set out in the Handbook. An externship that otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining EL credit will be approved for EL credit when the field placement provides specialized experience complementary to a student's intended career path and comparable benefits cannot be obtained through other EL coursework at Stanford. Grading Elements used: Full participation and attendance, satisfactory evaluation by field placement supervisor, weekly reflection papers of three to five pages, and a final reflection paper of a length to be determined by your faculty supervisor.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mandatory P\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":12,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Law Unit Limitation","name":"ULMT","schedule_print":true,"value":"LAWUNTLMT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1025,"component":"PRC","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Law Unit Limitation.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Students are California Bar Certified and thus appear in court and argue cases with faculty standing by. Students take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with prosecutors, drafting and arguing motions, and examining law enforcement and other witnesses. Common charges include drug use and possession, assault, theft, and vandalism. While students have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all work is closely supervised by experienced faculty. The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced, and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias in the legal system, immigration consequences, economic disparities, and addiction. The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. The Clinic's broader goal is to provide lawyering skills and habits of mind transferrable to any student's chosen field of practice. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need. The emotional challenges of the Clinic's work are addressed through an integrated self-care curriculum. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office or other locations as directed during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) that would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students are California Bar Certified and thus appear in court and argue cases with faculty standing by. Students take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with prosecutors, drafting and arguing motions, and examining law enforcement and other witnesses. Common charges include drug use and possession, assault, theft, and vandalism. While students have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all work is closely supervised by experienced faculty. The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced, and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias in the legal system, immigration consequences, economic disparities, and addiction. The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. The Clinic's broader goal is to provide lawyering skills and habits of mind transferrable to any student's chosen field of practice. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need. The emotional challenges of the Clinic's work are addressed through an integrated self-care curriculum. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office or other locations as directed during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) that would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments, case work including written or oral advocacy, and professionalism.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":34440,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":9,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":8,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

Students formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and conduct evidentiary motions, preliminary hearings, and occasional nonjury trials. The cases concern thefts, burglaries, assaults, weapons possession, drunk driving, drug distribution, and a range of other crimes. Students offer testimony by police officers, crime victims, and other witnesses and cross-examine defense witnesses, including those defendants who take the stand. Clinic students spend at least four full days a week -- Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays -- at the D.A.'s office or in court. There generally will be two class sessions each week: a three-hour on-campus class on Wednesday mornings and a Tuesday lunch seminar at the D.A.'s office. Toward the beginning of our term, classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument. Toward the end of the term our classroom focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice. Topics include the impact of race, gender, and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers. Students typically tour the Santa Clara County crime lab, Solano State Prison, FCI-Dublin (a federal women's prison), and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system. Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings. During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor. Evidence is a prerequisite. Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged. Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework. Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy. Class attendance is mandatory. Grading is on the H\/P system. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses: All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered fulltime for twelve credits. This format allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without having to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams, and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic may not enroll in any other class, seminar, directed research, or other credit-yielding activity within the Law School or University during their clinical quarter. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a daytime class regularly. There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved case by case. The clinical quarter begins on the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from onsite and faculty supervisors. Students are expected to be available by email or cellphone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work. In some weeks casework may demand much longer hours. Enrollment in a clinic is binding: Once a student has applied to and been selected by a clinic, the student may not drop the course except in rare cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (fulltime or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school careers. For more general information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Please note that due to the present pandemic, some activities of this clinic will require adjustment and perhaps cancellation in the Winter 2021 term.  Prison visits and police ride-alongs may prove impossible, and many court hearings may take place remotely.  Some hearings, however, are likely to proceed in Superior Court in San Jose, and some aspects of supervision and case preparation are likely to take place at the District Attorney's office in San Jose.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":2,"max_units_repeat":8,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1069,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":6,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases. The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

This Clinic gives students the opportunity to work directly with the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as they navigate the vast challenges faced by human rights advocates and victims. In addition to operating within the human rights framework, students will also have occasion to study and contribute to efforts to resolve situations of tension and ongoing conflict using tools of transitional justice and conflict mitigation. The course aims to help students develop a broad range of multidisciplinary human rights advocacy skills--including factual documentation; litigation before national, regional, and international institutions; community empowerment strategies; and client enfranchisement and representation--through in-class sessions, role play exercises, and engagement in, and critical assessment of, clinical projects in human rights.  This Clinic involves both a weekly seminar as well as work directly with clients and partner organizations (i.e. Clinic Projects). Together, these experiences give students the chance to reflect upon a number of foundational questions including: What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension?  Students will also be confronted with the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing human rights work and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical rounds in line with greater Mills Legal Clinic model. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the Clinic. During the course of the quarter, in addition to their work for their clients and partners, students will also be required to write several short, critical reflection papers or thought pieces (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words) on the readings, their Clinic Project(s), and\/or human rights events on campus. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses. The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. As a general rule, students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work\/projects (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical work product (i.e., the students' substantive contributions); clinical methods (which includes consideration of the students' lawyering skills, leadership, and professionalism); and clinical coursework (which focuses on the students' seminar participation, simulations, and reflection papers). Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Elements used in grading include: Attendance, class participation, written assignments, professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking, peer review, and commitment to the clinical enterprise.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and the clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[],"title":"International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic: Clinical Practice","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2020-2021"},"170":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"code":"912B","course_id":210562,"description":"In the past half-century, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discourse and practice.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.  A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic. - - Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, preparation for and participation in clinic seminar; reflection papers; and clinical case and project work including specific elements of methodical analysis, critical thinking, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and strategy development, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1043,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":8,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, preparation for and participation in clinic seminar; reflection papers; and clinical case and project work including specific elements of methodical analysis, critical thinking, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and strategy development, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1045,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":8,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

We're designed for both students interested in M&amp;A, capital markets, emerging company, tech transactions or other corporate work, and those wanting to explore a non-litigation, advisory-oriented practice. Prior experience in business or corporate law is welcome but certainly not necessary.  Students represent multiple clients during the term. Our clients are all established nonprofit corporations. Most generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $100 million, and some are larger. These clients have boards of directors, run complex programs, own brands and other intellectual property, and engage in a range of transactions, yet are small enough that our contact is almost always the CEO, CFO, general counsel, or other senior executive.  O&amp;T client engagements provide students with opportunities to assess facts; develop advice; read and write contracts, corporate governance materials, emails and other client communications; lead meetings and calls with clients; collaborate with colleagues; and manage projects. Our practice is document-intensive and service-oriented; we focus on clear communication and crisp execution.  The course includes a class that generally meets twice a week. Class meetings center on student-led workshops regarding client projects and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management. Guests often join us; those are occasions for informal conversations with general counsels and law firm partners.

We're designed for both students interested in M&amp;A, capital markets, emerging company, tech transactions or other corporate work, and those wanting to explore a non-litigation, advisory-oriented practice. Prior experience in business or corporate law is welcome but certainly not necessary.  Students represent multiple clients during the term. Our clients are all established nonprofit corporations. Most generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $100 million, and some are larger. These clients have boards of directors, run complex programs, own brands and other intellectual property, and engage in a range of transactions, yet are small enough that our contact is almost always the CEO, CFO, general counsel, or other senior executive.  O&amp;T client engagements provide students with opportunities to assess facts; develop advice; read and write contracts, corporate governance materials, emails and other client communications; lead meetings and calls with clients; collaborate with colleagues; and manage projects. Our practice is document-intensive and service-oriented; we focus on clear communication and crisp execution.  The course includes a class that generally meets twice a week. Class meetings center on student-led workshops regarding client projects and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management. Guests often join us; those are occasions for informal conversations with general counsels and law firm partners.  Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: The syllabus includes specific expectations and criteria relating to methodical analysis, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and crisp execution, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1090,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.  For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Written work, editing of other student's written work, attendance, class and moot court participation.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1046,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":9,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Written work, editing of other student's written work, attendance, class and moot court participation.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1048,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":9,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with coalitions and\/or other education-sector agencies to advance equity-minded educational policies and school reform. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students. Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaborations with non-profit clients. The education clinic includes a one-week intensive training program held at the beginning of the quarter, weekly seminars that focus on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a many opportunities for feedback and reflection with the instructors.

All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with coalitions and\/or other education-sector agencies to advance equity-minded educational policies and school reform. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students. Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaborations with non-profit clients. The education clinic includes a one-week intensive training program held at the beginning of the quarter, weekly seminars that focus on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a many opportunities for feedback and reflection with the instructors. Admission is by consent of instructor. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units.

Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register.

Yet despite the common attributes of the corporation familiar to every U.S. law student, corporations around the world have diverse ownership structures, interact in their domestic political economies in different ways, and exhibit a host of traits that vary with the institutional context in which they operate. This seminar explores the many forms corporate capitalism takes around the world, the forces that shape domestic corporate law and governance in major countries, and the important legal and policy issues raised by global corporate activity. We will explore the rise of &quot;agency capitalism&quot; in the U.S. and the proliferation of new forms of corporate ownership around the world, the emergence of Chinese state capitalism and its legal and policy consequences, efforts to reform Japanese stakeholder-oriented capitalism, and the emergence of hybrid forms of business organization designed to pursue both profits and social benefits. Policy issues to be considered include the &quot;social responsibility&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; of the corporation, the national security implications of foreign investment by state-owned enterprises, and the consequences of global hedge fund activism.

Naturally we will examine reorganization through several stages of a business turnaround and restructuring (such as an out-of-court workout, a chapter 11 filing, selected chapter 11 operating issues, and the formulation, negotiation and confirmation of a plan of reorganization). But we will also view chapter 11 in terms of its effects upon financing transactions that are negotiated long before bankruptcy becomes necessary.  After all, the terms of a financing transaction probably are most important when things do not work out as well as hoped or planned, because it is then that the relative rights of parties become critically important.  Thus, a fundamental knowledge of chapter 11 is not just for bankruptcy specialists, but it is also important for non-bankruptcy lawyers and businesspeople who help structure complex financing transactions in anticipation of the cold reality that something, someday, could financially go wrong.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the &quot;final cut&quot; and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations. The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

The first week of each case study will involve the negotiation and structuring of an M&amp;A transaction.  The second week will involve litigation relating to the transaction. As part of the case studies, students will negotiate a transaction, advise their client, take depositions, write briefs and present oral argument.  Reading for the case studies will include case scenarios, supporting materials, and additional relevant case law and articles.  Written assignments and grading. Students will be expected to write a final paper, in addition to the brief they will write in connection with their assigned case study.

Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront: --How does business activity affect human rights and other &quot;social&quot; goods (such as the environment and community cohesion)?  --What factors, internal and external to companies, shape corporate decisions that have human rights\/social impacts? When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns? -- What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives? We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground.

We will dive into the role of the board post-investment, with a particular emphasis on the fiduciary duties (often conflicting) of the board in governing a venture capital financed business. In particular, we will look at the role of the board in financing activities, M&amp;A activities and various special situations. The course will utilize case law as well as various articles and case studies to articulate the potential governance issues boards may encounter.

The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provide consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and\/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as: telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

FinTech generally refers to disruptive financial sector innovations involving technology-enabled (online and mobile device-based) business models.  Independent FinTech businesses can facilitate disintermediation, create and deliver novel products and services, increase access and inclusivity, reduce costs and both create and address privacy, regulatory and law-enforcement challenges.  FinTech can also refer to the increasingly technological approaches that both incumbents and entrepreneurial ventures take to the main financial intermediation functions, e.g., maturity transformation, payments, capital raising and remittances, and to &quot;back end&quot; data systems and regulatory compliance.  The goal of the course will be for students to understand the major categories of FinTech innovation in the U.S., including crypto currency and blockchain, the evolving business models and regulatory and legal structures that underlie these categories, and the opportunities and risks that emerging FinTech business models create for financial, legal and regulatory systems.  Non-U.S. examples will be used to compare and contrast different approaches to key policy issues.  Four key themes will be emphasized:  1) Understanding innovative business models in emerging FinTech.  2) FinTech competition and cooperation with the existing financial services ecosystem and 'big tech.'  3) Financial regulatory and legal system coverage of, mismatches with, and adaptation to, emerging FinTech business models.  4) Public Policy issues surrounding FinTech (Innovation and efficiency; Personal financial data ownership, use, control and liability; Financial stability; Financial inclusion and consumer financial health).  No prerequisites but professor permission will take into account relevant background. Elements used in grading: class participation, class assignments and final take-home assignment.

While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect. At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity &quot;impact investments&quot; that typically incur greater risks than pure market rate investments. This course will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including: the meanings and measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG criteria; disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks; when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other nonpecuniary goals; constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior; proposals for broadening the purpose of corporations; barriers to these various practices and proposals; and whether they can be accommodated within neoliberal ideology or require a new framework. You may write a series of short commentaries on four of the sessions. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single empirical research paper on a topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors\/Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis. Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit (section 02), depending on the project and paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  This class is limited to 20 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 students by lottery) and 5 GSB students by instructor consent.

America has adopted an array of increasingly tough approaches to crime, including aggressive street-level policing, longer sentences, and a range of collateral consequences for criminal convictions.  As a result, there are currently 2.2 million persons in prisons and jails and seven million under some form of correctional supervision.  The impact on communities of color has been especially profound: In many of our nation's cities, nearly one-half of young black men are in the criminal justice system.  This seminar will begin with readings discussing the tough-on-crime era's historical roots. We will then turn to examine the impact of these policies. Finally, we will turn to current efforts to resist and reform the system that has been created.

In many ways, the era of mass incarceration began in California with the enactment of the &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot; sentencing law in 1994. Today, California leads political and policy trends in the opposite direction with a number of critical reforms to the state's justice system. In this seminar students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing policies in California and across the country. Students also assist with live litigation on behalf of inmates sentenced to life in prison for nonviolent crimes. Students also have the opportunity to contribute to ongoing research, public policy analysis and advocacy in the area of criminal justice reform.  The class focuses largely on California's Three Strikes law as a case study in the history, politics, constitutional doctrine, and reform of criminal justice policy throughout the country. Students will test their skills in the field by assisting with the representation of individual inmates sentenced to long prison terms for nonviolent crimes in state and federal courts.  The Project has been intimately involved in the movement to reduce incarceration in California and throughout the country, partnering with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Obama administration on different projects including direct legislative reform, impact litigation, executive clemency, and prisoner reentry. Students enrolled in the seminar quickly become involved in all aspects of the Project's work, including assistance with different stages of ongoing litigation. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigations, and draft petitions on our clients' behalf.  The Project is an active, fast-paced organization that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in this seminar. This seminar offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law and to hone practical litigation and advocacy skills in and out of the courtroom. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week, including 1 hour individual meetings with Project director Mike Romano. CONSENT APPLICATION: Interested students must apply to enroll in the seminar by sending a one-page statement of interest and resume by email with the subject line &quot;application&quot; to Mike Romano (mromano@stanford.edu).

Sentencing is the process by which criminal sanctions are imposed in individual cases following criminal convictions. Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable. The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore: (1) sentencing theories and their application; (2) the nature, scope and function of jails, prisons, probation and parole; (3) the impact of incarceration on crime, communities, and racial justice; (4) the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs; (5) the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction; (6) special prison populations (e.g., mentally ill) and policies (e.g., solitary confinement); (7) prison litigation and conditions of confinement; and (8) parole, risk prediction, and prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates. Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation (which will include a class presentation), and three reflection papers of 5 to 7 pages each.

The aggressive use of the criminal laws to respond to perceived financial abuse probably had its birth in the prosecution of Michael Milken. Although folks will differ about the prosecution, there is no realistic dispute about the influence Mr MILKEN has had in creating the markets which made possible for new ideas and ventures to have access to the capital needed to build and thrive. . MILKEN effectively developed the so called &quot;junk bonds&quot; market which was the engine that allowed for this theoretically high risk capital to be effectively deployed. As the high yield market grew, Michael Milken and the firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham became the largest and most effective competitor in the market place. This led to a call for an investigation and coincided with a significant insider trading investigation centered on Ivan Boesky (fictionalized in the first Wall Street movie). The US Attorney in NY at the time was Rudolph Giulliani (later Mayor of NY and, more recently, know for his representation of President Trump in various matters including the Ukrainian matter) who led the investigation. Ultimately Mr MILKEN was indicted and pled guilty and was imprisoned. This seminar will involve an in depth study of the circumstances surrounding the high yield securities market and the investigation, indictment and guilty pleas and the subsequent impact of the case. The seminar will examine the tools available to prosecutors, including the use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in white collar cases, in pursuing this and other cases, the affect of the media in high profile cases and other systemic elements that come into play. The seminar will feature presentations of many colorful key players including those involved in the prosecution and defense and those with knowledge of the high yield markets. The seminar will be taught jointly by Professor Mills (who was intimately involved with Mr MILKEN and defended some of the other cases which arose at the time) and Richard Sandler who served as Michael Milken's personal counsel throughout the time and has continued to work with Michael Milken to the present time.

Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted.

What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing &quot;big picture,&quot; synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather than just working within the doctrinal and institutional structures that exist at present. For students interested in legal academia, this course will develop your ability to read sophisticated theoretical material, to write in the same vein, and to relate theoretical ideas to policy prescriptions.

The emphasis will not be on doctrines of criminal law, or (for the most part) on reported case law; but rather on the relationship between the working criminal justice system and American society.  Indeed, throughout our history, there has been a huge gulf between the formal law and the way the system actually operated.  At all points, the criminal justice system has responded to social, economic, political and cultural factors; and it is these that the course will focus on.  The students will read a number of original sources that bear on the relationship between law and society, including sources on the rise of the penitentiary, the death penalty, the development of correctional methods, such as parole and indeterminate sentences; also race and gender relations and their influence on criminal justice.  The course will also look at the rise and fall of laws controlling moral and sexual behavior.  Students will be expected to write brief reflection papers (roughly two pages) before each of the sessions in which readings will be discussed.  The reflection papers should not be mere summaries of the readings, rather, students will explain how the readings bore on the general theme or themes of the course; and the student's reaction to the writer's point of view.  Each student will also be asked to develop a topic, carry out research, and write a paper on one or more aspects of the history of criminal justice.  Papers can either be synthetic (a review of the literature on some aspect of the history of criminal justice) or embody original research, using such material as court files, older treatises, and newspaper and periodical literature.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. Automatic grading penalty waived for writers.  Elements used in grading:  The grade in the seminar will be based on the paper, and (to a degree) also on class participation, including the reflection papers and an extended take-home exam or an independent research paper.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Extended Take-Home Exam","name":"AEXA","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXTENDED"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Criminal Justice","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"CRIMJUST"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Law and Humanities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LAW&HUM"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Open to First-Year JD Students","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"1LJDOPEN"}],"class_id":31989,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":9,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Extended Take-Home Exam.

This course surveys the legal and ethical principles for assessing the equity of algorithms, describes statistical techniques for designing fair systems, and considers how anti-discrimination law and the design of algorithms may need to evolve to account for machine bias.

Various surveillance techniques will be examined, such as cell site simulators, GPS and RFID tracking devices, remote computer access (NITs), biometric identification, facial recognition technology, and automated license plate readers.  The novel legal and practical issues generated by computer-based search techniques will be explored, for example: Should the plain view exception apply to computer searches? Are ex ante  conditions on computer search warrants necessary, or even advisable? When is compulsion of biometric device identifiers appropriate? Can providers be compelled to decrypt locked cell phones? What are the notice requirements for search warrants directed to service providers? What limits should be placed on border searches of electronic devices? After the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in Carpenter, what rules govern law enforcement access to medical or genetic databases maintained by third parties? How is a cell tower dump order distinguishable from a general warrant? What are the particularity requirements for search warrants seeking electronically stored information? Should there be super-warrant requirements pertaining to minimization and overcollection for such searches? What about extraterritoriality and conflict of law issues raised by U.S. law enforcement access to data stored on foreign servers?  Broader policy questions will also be addressed. For example, is it sensible to rely on the exclusionary rule to develop Fourth Amendment doctrine in this &quot;golden age of surveillance&quot;? Are courts or legislatures better equipped to regulate modern police investigations? What lessons can be learned from comparative approaches to police regulation in other countries?  The course will build upon foundations laid in the Criminal Procedure--Investigation and Criminal Procedure--Adjudication courses. Those classes touch upon the basics of search warrants and the Fourth Amendment, and both are recommended prerequisites for this class.  The next generation of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and civil rights advocates will be forced to apply existing legal precedent to unprecedented surveillance technologies generated by the digital era.

We will hear from experts and leaders from law enforcement, prosecution, public defense, the judiciary, and corrections, and policy experts (including from the academic world). The thematic coverage of the course will be broad, covering empirical assessments of the state of criminal justice in the US, efforts to bring the country out of the phase of mass incarceration while maintaining record-low crime rates, reforms in our sentencing laws (including the death penalty), assessing what is meant by the rubric &quot;progressive prospection,&quot; the workload challenges of public defenders, addressing the problem of wrongful convictions, and racial discrimination in both investigation and adjudication of crime.  Each week there will be a Zoom interview with a guest. The instructors will interview the guests, and students will then participate in a Q and A phase. The interview sessions will generally run 90 minutes. For each guest there will be preassigned material  to be read before the interview. Within 2 days after each interview, students will turn in 3-page reflection papers derived from the interview and reading.  The final product will be a 10-page essay on a topic that has emerged from the course. This 10 page paper need not me a scholarly or research endeavor. It can be, in effect, a more extended reflection essay.  We anticipate that for most weeks we will have one guest, either Monday or Wednesday, and the other day will be reserved for more elaborate discussions of the most previous guest's presentation or of  reading for the next guest. There may be one or 2 weeks where we have 2 guests. While we are just now settling the guest list and anticipate some very exciting additions,  for sure it will include Barry Scheck, founder of the famed Innocence Project.  Professor Rachel Barkow of NYU. Leading authority on criminal justice administration. Earlonne Woods, former California life prisoner and co-creator and now co-producer and writer for of the Ear Hustle podcast.  George Gascon, former Police Chief and former District Attorney of San Francisco and now candidate for Los Angeles County District Attorney.  Professor John Donohue  of Stanford, widely regarded as the nation's leading empirical researcher of crime and sentencing.

As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sutherland recognized in the context of federal prosecutors, &quot;[t]he United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.&quot; A U.S. Attorney may &quot;strike hard blows&quot; but not &quot;foul ones.&quot; This course examines the distinct roles and responsibilities of U.S. Attorneys in the enforcement of federal criminal laws. We will review the ways in which a federal prosecutor exercises discretion in deciding whether or not to charge, what crimes to charge, and what punishments to seek. We will examine charging both individuals and corporate entities in the context of the priorities and policies of different administrations as well as the prosecutor's individual ethical obligations. This will be done on both a practical and conceptual level. Introductory sessions will focus on the historical evolution of the office, beginning with the Judiciary Act of 1789, and examine the office's complex (and unique) role within the system of separation of powers (including the appointment of Independent Counsel, Special Counsel and the judicial appointment of United States Attorneys). It will also explore related theoretical questions involving the prosecutorial role as well as challenges to the constitutionality of the judicial role in selecting US Attorneys. The bulk of the course will involve class sessions centered on different federal cases that involved difficult questions of prosecutorial decision-making. We will discuss the tools prosecutors use in exercising their discretion, including non-prosecution agreements, deferred prosecution agreements and cooperation agreements. The course will also explore the relationship between the U.S. Attorney and &quot;Main Justice&quot; and the extent to which the U.S. Attorney has independent decision-making authority. It will delve into the conflicts that may arise, and it will examine the appropriate framework for resolution of those conflicts.  All students will write a paper for the class.  Students may optionally elect to write an independent research paper for R credit.  Students should submit at least 15 pages in the non-R (01) section.  Students receiving R credit must abide by the Law School's research paper requirements -- which have the effect, because this is a three-credit course, of imposing a 26-page minimum.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can email registrar@law.stanford.edu to transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

Contemporary litigation frequently involves multiple related actions, multiple parties, and multiple claims that may interact in complex ways, and often aspires to reform institutions in addition to seeking remedies for discrete past harms. This course introduces procedural doctrine, theory, and practice related to complex and\/or public law litigation, including such topics as the joinder of claims and parties, claim and issue preclusion, class action law, multidistrict litigation and other forms of aggregation, and the turn towards mandatory arbitration. The course should be of particular interest to aspiring litigators (in any substantive area) and public interest lawyers (litigators or otherwise), and complements other curricular offerings in complex and constitutional litigation.

A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal court litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements, in response to which the federal courts have developed. Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create &quot;legislative courts&quot; outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers. The course is strongly recommended for students interested in pursuing a career in litigation and\/or judicial clerkships in the federal courts.  Special Instructions:  In Winter 2020 the Federal Courts class will be conducted as a tutorial.  This means that required class participation will include several components: (a) weekly pre-recorded lectures introducing assigned materials, (b) recorded lectures summarizing units of coverage, and (c) weekly small group tutorial sessions.  The small group tutorial sessions will be conducted with groups of fewer than five students who will work directly with Professor Spaulding every week as a pod.  Every tutorial group will have at least one session during the regularly scheduled hours for the course during the quarter, but most sessions will take place during other mutually convenient time slots each week.  Online scheduling software will generate tutorial session schedules for the quarter.  Enrolled students will be asked to identify their scheduling availability before the term begins.  Tutorial sessions will run approximately one hour each week and will be led by Professor Spaulding -- in person if health regulations and weather permit, but most likely via remote video link.  The goal of the tutorial format is to create an engaging, interactive, and intellectually rigorous setting for discussion of the course materials and themes after students have viewed the introductory lecture each week.  Teaching assistants will hold office hours during the regularly scheduled course time each week as well.  Elements used in grading:  Grading will be based on attendance, participation, short exercises, and a take home final exam.  Interested students should contact Professor Spaulding at nspaulding@law.stanford.edu for permission to enroll.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"One-Day Take-Home Exam","name":"AEXA","schedule_print":true,"value":"ONEDAY"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Public Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"PUBLLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Advanced Procedure","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"ADVPROC"}],"class_id":1078,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":50,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":40,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"One-Day Take-Home Exam.

Very quickly, the cases are consolidated in the federal court in Northern California. Meanwhile, special purpose foundations are established in the Netherlands to seek a settlement with VW on behalf of European consumers under the Dutch collective settlement act, and a securities lawsuit on behalf of investors whose share values have dropped dramatically is filed in Germany, using that country's special group litigation procedure. The Dutch foundations may be coordinating their actions with US lawyers, the shareholders in Germany are represented by the local partners of a leading US-based litigation boutique, and the shareholder suit is funded by a UK-based international litigation financing firm. In 2019, a jury in E.D. Va. delivers a verdict holding a former Somali army commander now living in the U.S. liable under the Torture Victim Protection Act for compensatory and punitive damages to a Somali citizen he injured 30 years ago. The plaintiff is represented by the Center for Justice &amp; Accountability in San Francisco and DLA Piper lawyers serving pro bono; the witnesses include public and private actors from different countries. In 2011, US-based Apple sues Korea-based Samsung for patent infringement in N.D. CA and Samsung counter-sues in Korea, Japan and Germany. A year later more than 50 lawsuits are ongoing in more than 10 countries. Two years later the companies agree to drop their litigation outside the US and focus their resources on their US litigation battle. Apple wins a big judgment in the federal court in San Jose but Samsung appeals all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. SCOTUS rejects the appeal and remands and in Spring 2018 the case is on the calendar for the third time in San Jose. Philip Morris' Hong Kong subsidiary files a claim in an international arbitration tribunal charging that Australia's public health protection statute regarding tobacco marketing violates Australia's bi-lateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The arbitration claim is filed after the parent company unsuccessfully challenged Australia's statute before the High Court. In December 2015 the arbitration tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction over Philip Morris' claim effectively dismissing it. But controversy over Philip Morris' and other multi-national corporations' attempts to use investment arbitration to challenge diverse health, safety and environmental protection regulations derails international trade negotiations and leads to efforts to establish an international court for investment disputes. These high-profile cases illustrate an important aspect of complex litigation: across many different substantive domains, in court and ADR proceedings, disputes that used to be contained within national borders are now trans-national. This seminar will consider the doctrinal, procedural and practical challenges that arise when litigation goes global. We will consider the high profile cases in which these issues have played out in recent years and hear from some of the lawyers who are creating a new virtual international court system for the resolution of global disputes. The goal of the seminar is to develop an understanding of how the global dimension of high-stakes complex disputes shapes parties' and lawyers' strategies and judges' decisions. The seminar will meet 3 times a week. A small number of seminar sessions will be conducted in collaboration with law faculty and students in Canada, the Netherlands and Germany, three countries that have adopted procedures for dealing with large-scale civil litigation in distinctive fashions.  Although teaching plans for the fall quarter are still somewhat in flux, I expect that I will teach this seminar mainly on-line, although I hope there will be an opportunity to hold a few introductory sessions in person. Guest speakers will appear online. Where time differences permit, sessions with guest speakers will be synchronous; otherwise I will record interviews with our guests, which we will then play in class and discuss.

In the U.S. in addition to resolving run-of the-mill commercial disputes, arbitration may be used to resolve claims invoking anti-trust, securities, and civil rights law, and consumers, employees, patients and other individual claimants may be held to arbitration provisions included in form contracts drafted by corporations that the individuals overlooked or barely understood. Businesses too may find themselves held to an arbitration clause hastily chosen by a transactional lawyer who didn't understand what she was committing her client to. Economic globalization has created increased demand for international commercial arbitration, which offers binding resolution of trans-national business disputes, enforceable in virtually every court in the world. The increased frequency of complex high-value international transactions involving key industries -- e.g. energy and telecommunications -- has led to an increasing fraction of transnational business disputes with a significant public policy dimension. Moreover, the desires of countries with less developed economies to attract foreign direct investment has led to the creation of a specialized form of arbitration for disputes between private investors and states.  Often bundled with other forms of alternative dispute resolution (&quot;ADR&quot;) such as mediation, arbitration is actually a rule-defined adjudicative procedure, in which parties submit their disputes to privately-chosen and privately-paid decision-makers who deliver binding (and usually unappealable) outcomes, often in closed proceedings. The law that governs arbitration is a mix of domestic statutes (e.g., in the U.S., the Federal Arbitration Act) and international conventions (e.g., the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (&quot;ICSID&quot;)) that have been entered into by a large majority of countries.  Today, arbitration offers a challenging and lucrative practice area to lawyers representing corporations in multiple industries, in domestic and international contexts, and to lawyers serving as arbitrators, who often command high hourly rates. Understanding the differences and similarities among arbitration law and practice in multiple domains and the intersection of public and private law is valuable to lawyers who specialize in arbitration. This seminar is intended for students who wish to develop this capacity as well as for students who want to understand better how to draft business contracts that will protect their clients should they find themselves subject to arbitration.  Although arbitration is well-accepted around the world, certain applications of arbitration have become increasingly controversial. In the U.S. the requirement that employees agree to arbitrate sexual harassment claims as a condition of employment has led to boycotts against &quot;big law&quot; firms. Requirements to arbitrate disputes between private investors and national governments have knocked high-profile multi-lateral trade negotiations off-track. Some business decision-makers are turning away from arbitration for &quot;ordinary&quot; commercial disputes, arguing that it has become as expensive and time-consuming as court adjudication, without the protections of the latter.  In this course we will consider separately and together, the statutes that provide the legal framework for arbitration, the specific rules that govern different types of arbitration, the ongoing controversies evoked by some of these rules and their application, and the reforms that have been proposed in response to these controversies. We will read and discuss U.S. case law, international arbitration decisions, academic commentary and empirical analyses of arbitration use and consequences, and hear from leading arbitration practitioners. Students will select aspects of arbitration law or practice or the controversies that surround it and write research papers on their topic of interest.

More than 10 million Americans 12 years and older are estimated to have misused opioids in 2018, most of which misuse was linked to prescription drugs. Approximately 47,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in that year. Opioid use is reported to have peaked in 2011 but opioid addiction remains a problem in many parts of the country (CNN Editorial Research, &quot;Opioid Crisis Fast Facts,&quot;  June 21, 2020, available at https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/18\/health\/opioid-crisis-fast-facts\/index.html).  The opioid crisis presents a variety of public policy challenges. Like the Crack epidemic of the 1980s, opioid misuse has had disproportionate effects on certain communities. While the former disproportionately affected poor Black urban communities and other urban communities of color, the latter has primarily affected poor White communities, particularly in non-coastal areas of the country. The former was met with popular criticism of its victims and draconian criminal justice policies that incarcerated a generation of Black Americans and other people of color. The latter has been met with an outpouring of concerned media commentary, and funding (however insufficient) for public treatment programs. It is difficult not to conclude that systemic engrained racism explains much of this difference.  The opioid crisis also differs from the crack crisis, however, in that opioid victims and their advocates have been able to target responsible parties and attempt to hold them accountable for the harm and losses their conduct has imposed on addicts, their families and their communities. It is widely agreed that the origin of the epidemic was the virtually unlimited distribution of prescription opioid drugs, allegedly encouraged by the drug manufacturers and enabled by other corporations in the pharmaceutical supply chain and by the physicians who prescribed the drugs. The opioid epidemic has also led to a wide-ranging litigation, which has taken as its role model earlier litigation against tobacco manufacturers and ongoing litigation against gun manufacturers. The opioid litigation stands as an example of joining private and public civil litigation to claim compensation for losses due to alleged wrongdoing by private corporations and in the process reshape public policy with regard to harm. To prevail against defendants, plaintiffs have had to persuade courts to apply liability doctrine in unusual although not entirely new ways.  Much of the litigation resulting from opioid overdoses and addiction has been contested in the federal courts, which have deployed an armamentarium of formal and informal procedural rules and practices developed over the past several decades to manage and resolve large-scale litigation. Innovative approaches have been adopted by the federal judge assigned to manage the litigation. Key defendants have chosen to manage their liability by seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts.  In sum, the opioid litigation offers opportunities to consider the roles of socio-economic inequality and racial attitudes in shaping perceptions of harm, the potential of tort law to provide remedies for losses, and the challenge of pursuing remedies for mass loss in federal courts. Through readings, guest lectures, discussion and individual research papers on relevant topics of your choice, this seminar will provide both practical information about litigating mass tort claims and space to consider the appropriate role of courts in solving social policy problems.

The U.S. energy system today is subject to a complex regime of state and federal laws. We will examine the historical role of state-level electric utility regulation, tracing its evolution into the various forms of regulated and deregulated energy markets now in use in the U.S. electricity and natural gas sectors. Contemporary energy law increasingly involves a delicate federalist balance where state and federal regulators share overlapping authority in contested policy areas that are subject to major technological and economic change. Finally, we will interrogate the contested ideals of regulation and competition, which private, non-profit, and governmental stakeholders deploy in legal and political fora to advance private gain and public goods. Students who complete the class will gain a historical understanding of how economic regulation of the energy sector has evolved since the early 20th century, a durable conceptual framework for understanding modern energy law and policy debates, and a practical understanding of energy law designed for future practitioners.

In many cases, private companies have made important contributions to meeting water needs (e.g., in the development of new technologies and expanding water supplies).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established or emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues that they generate. These businesses include investor-owned water utilities, water technology companies (e.g., companies investing in new desalination or water recycling technologies), water-right funds (who directly buy and sell water rights), social impact funds, innovative agricultural operations, water concessionaires, and infrastructure construction companies and investors.

The project development business--far more than many other businesses such as tech, manufacturing, consumer, services, retail or transportation--inherently involves a VERY long list of highly-germane and critical legal issues.  We address the legal issues from the perspective of what a business person needs to understand in order to navigate them and complete a project.  The primary course materials will be documents from several representative projects -- e.g., solar, wind, storage, carbon capture, transmission, combined heat &amp; power -- covering key areas including market and feasibility studies, environmental permitting and regulatory decisions, financial disclosure from bank and bond transactions, and construction, input, and offtake contracts. For virtually every clean energy project, legal documents and financial\/business models tend to highly customized. By examining actual projects and transactions we can learn how developers, financiers, and lawyers work to get deals over the finish line--deals that meet the demands of the market, the requirements of the law, and (sometimes) broader societal goals, in particular climate change, economic competitiveness, and energy security.

We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment.

The seminar will meet six times during the Spring Quarter.  The heart of the series will include four seminars with panels of outside experts covering the following topics:  1) The diversification of California's water supply portfolio; 2) The rise of the coequal goals of ecosystem restoration and water supply reliability; 3) The ongoing tension between collaborative and adversarial decision-making processes; and 4) Implications for water researchers seeking to help define pathways to meaningful solutions.  In addition to these four seminar sessions, there will be an introductory California Water 101 session for students and a closing session on what we have learned.  Students will be assigned readings and required to develop questions for discussion.  Lead instructor for the seminar will be Landreth Visiting Fellow Dr. Timothy Quinn.  Dr. Quinn spent more than ten years as the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, and more than twenty years as the Deputy General Manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.

Scientists have developed new biologic drugs to cure cancer, complex algorithms to identify public health risks or predict disease, and 3D-printed medical devices. Biomedical research is also tremendously expensive. In this seminar we will examine the economics of biomedical R&amp;D and the legal framework that is designed to incentivize new advances, with an emphasis on pharmaceuticals. We will consider policy tools including patents and other intellectual property, FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity, prizes, grants, tax incentives, and insurance reimbursement. We will also discuss how these incentives are funded and what this means for allocating access to medical technologies, both in the United States and abroad. The current policy mix of innovation incentives and access allocation mechanisms is far from perfect, and students will have the opportunity to discuss reform proposals with real-world biomedical innovators from different sectors. There are no prerequisites, and no technical or economic background is required, but students should be willing to learn about biomedical technologies, detailed legal frameworks, and economic policies.

How serious are the concerns about moral hazard and adverse selection---core concepts of insurance law? What standards should be used to resolve insurance bad faith claims?  And, when a party is sued and the liability insurer controls the party's defense, how should the defense lawyer hired by the insurer navigate---and conceive of---this triangular relationship? The pervasive role of insurance in addressing societal concerns about accidental harm is vitally important but has been remarkably under-examined in the traditional law school curriculum.

Constitutional, civil and economic rights have been created, such as marriage equality and strict liability in tort, but rights have also been limited through statutory restrictions and other means. The role of the judge has grown to activist and administrator in cases such as prison reform and housing desegregation. And through it all, it has been lawyers who have fought, won, and lost the battles of expansion and contraction of rights and remedies. Where the government fails to protect us, private practitioners serve a crucial role in challenging the legal &quot;status quo&quot; through civil litigation; vindication of a particular client's claim can simultaneously establish or clarify the rights in question on a societal scale.  Taught by an experienced trial lawyer, along with guests from both plaintiff and defense practices, course readings and discussion will draw on a wealth of textual, law review, and lay media, and the arc of relevant case law, including real trial experiences and litigation documents. This course explores changes in motor vehicle and commercial product safety, medical malpractice, police misconduct, civil rights, marital rights, sexual harassment and abuse, firearms liability, school and housing desegregation, college hazing, privacy, school funding and consumer safety. We'll study the titanic struggle over appropriate remedies for wrongs in these substantive areas, ranging from immunity to limits on recoveries, compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. We'll also study how a plaintiff or defense lawyer can make a difference for their clients and others similarly situated to catalyze significant societal improvement.

The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art, and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded?

The terms and stakes of this interplay will inform our readings of both fiction and legal texts and we will pay particular attention to points of contact and tension between literary narrative and the operation of narrative in legal discourse. Each week, a novel or story will be paired with a contemporary legal text (often an opinion) and background historical material. We will likely read fiction by Rebecca Harding Davis, Herman Melville, Henry James, Charles Chesnutt, Katherine Anne Porter, John Okada, Ralph Ellison, and Leslie Marmon Silko, but this list is not complete. Among other themes, we will track the effects of shifting legal constructions of citizenship, race, gender, and class; changes in the law of property, contract, and privacy; and deployments of the authority and violence of the state on the maintenance of personal identity, community stability, and linguistic meaning.

When we seek to persuade, we offer photographs, charts, videos. When we witness misconduct, we pull out our smartphones. And as images saturate our cultural discourse, they are increasingly part of legal practice. But the power of an image often lies in its apparent simplicity: we know it when we see it. How much of what we see, though, is produced by the biases and expectations -- the habits of viewing -- that we bring to the encounter? What is left out when an infographic distills information for us? Lawyers and judges tend to treat certain kinds of images as unmediated representations of reality, even though neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect. This na&iuml;ve realism maps on to an ideal of definitive proof embedded in the adversary system. Indeed, lawyers and judges have historically worried that images might replace legal process altogether. (That possibility now seems remote, though the Covid epidemic has quickly normalized video trials.) The more pressing challenge today is to adapt legal practice to visual persuasion in ways that are consistent with our rule of law values.  This interdisciplinary seminar tracks the legal reception of modern visual representation from confusion about the admissibility of photographs in the late 19th century (is it like a drawing? is it like eyewitness testimony?) to the debate about cameras in the courtroom in the late 20th century (do judges and jurors decide differently when the proceedings are televised?) to the frequent and strategic deployment of visual media in pretrial and litigation practice today. We will then consider the roles of visual persuasion in the law of privacy, qualified immunity, and freedom of speech, as well as applications in practice areas like contracts and client communications. Throughout the quarter, we will attend to the ways American visual culture has resisted and reinforced systemic inequality.

Within the last decade there has, however, been an explosion of energy in the field, which has expanded beyond the boundaries of the literary text narrowly conceived and incorporated a range of other genres and humanistic approaches. Several recent or forthcoming books survey the range of emerging scholarship and the potential for new directions within the field.  Using one of these--New Directions in Law and Literature (Oxford, 2017)--as a guide, this course will delve into a variety of topics that law and literature approaches can illuminate. These include, among others, conceptions of sovereignty and non-sovereign collectivities, the construction of the citizen and refugee, competing visions of marriage and its alternatives, law and the rhetorical tradition, and theoretical perspectives on intellectual property. Nearly every session will pair recent scholarship in the field with a literary or artistic work, ranging from Claudia Rankine's Citizen to Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.

We'll focus of the tension between law and justice, perhaps peeking forward to Melville's Billy Budd, and MLK Jr.'s Letter from the Birmingham Jail.  We will continue with the third play in Aeschylus' Oresteia, focusing on the decision to remit Orestes to the judgment of the people of Athens, rather than to the Furies, in connection with the murder of Clytemnestra.

Over the past decades, electronic media -- broadcast radio and television, cable television, telephony, and the Internet -- have become critical spaces where Americans speak to and with each other.  Today, being able to speak and be heard online is as important as being able to speak in parks, sidewalks, and public squares. As the Supreme Court has recognized, social media platforms &quot;provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard,&quot; so that any citizen may &quot;become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.&quot; Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017).  But while the public squares of the colonies were public spaces, the social media platforms hosting much of Americans' online speech today are owned by private actors with their own First Amendment rights. And the decisions courts have been making about electronic media differ significantly from the precedents governing leaflets, pickets, soapboxes, and burning flags that dominated the twentieth century.  This class complements the law school's general First Amendment class by focusing on the First Amendment precedents governing speech on electronic media (broadcast, cable, telephony, and the Internet) and what they mean for the First Amendment in the digital age.  We will grapple with questions such as: Why can comedians swear on Netflix or cable TV, but not on broadcast TV? Can the government ensure that speech spaces on electronic media are open to a variety of viewpoints? Can politicians or government officials block Americans from their Twitter or Facebook accounts? Do Internet platforms violate their users' First Amendment rights when they take down or restrict access to their content? And how does the First Amendment affect attempts to regulate Internet platforms, including President Trump's recent Executive Order?  Who should take this class: If you are interested in the First Amendment, constitutional issues, appellate litigation, media and technology law, communications law, net neutrality, the increasing power of Internet platforms, or simply use the Internet, this class is for you.  There are no prerequisites for this class. You can take it before or after the general First Amendment class. The class is open to first year law students and graduate students from other schools.

Network neutrality rules are based on a simple principle: Internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast that connect us to the Internet should not control what happens on the Internet. Net neutrality rules prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down websites, making some sites more attractive than others, or charging sites fees to reach people faster.  After a long, public fight that mobilized more than 4 million people across the political spectrum, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted strong net neutrality rules in February 2015. Now these rules might be on the chopping block. FCC Chairman Pai, who opposed the rules when they were adopted, has declared his intention to roll back the rules, while expressing some support for &quot;net neutrality principles.&quot; At the same time, Republicans in Congress have indicated they might consider a legislative solution.  Through lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, the seminar will introduce students to the key questions underlying the net neutrality debate so that they can become informed participants in this debate. Do we need net neutrality rules, and, if yes, what should they be? What are the options for addressing net neutrality at the FCC and in Congress? How do past court decisions constrain the FCC's options for adopting net neutrality rules? While the class focuses on the net neutrality debate in the U.S., the underlying policy questions are general and directly applicable to ongoing net neutrality debates around the world.

No issue in the digital age has demonstrated this better than the history of and litigation surrounding Google Books. For over a decade, from the inception of the product to the resolution of its legal issues, lawyers were integrally involved with engineers and the business every step of the way. They helped design its features, defend it from lawsuits, craft a settlement, and advocate complementary policy positions.  On a broader level, the history of ebooks is a microcosm of the opportunities and challenges of the digital age: new technologies to reproduce and distribute works, changing consumer norms, massive disruptions to economic interests, evolving concepts of fair use, increased access to information, fears about piracy, and threats to competition. Every one of these issues requires skilled lawyering in close partnership with business leadership.  This seminar will focus on strategic lawyering at the cutting edge of innovation by closely studying, among other things, the history of Google Books and the evolution of copyright in the digital age. We will look at how leading businesses, including Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, have each used law, litigation, and policy as tools to advance their business interests. We will focus on developments related to ebooks, and also study analogous issues involving the music, movie, and newspaper industries.  The seminar will include guest speakers who have led legal strategies to further innovation. Some copyright experience is helpful but not essential.

Technical, legal and economic choices will affect whether the Internet can realize its potential or not.  Communications law - the law that governs both the physical infrastructures for communications services such as cable and telephone networks as well as the communication services which are provided over these infrastructures - has become one of the most important arenas in which choices affecting the future of the information society are made. The debates over network neutrality or the right ways to foster broadband deployment are examples of this trend.  At the same time, the Internet's ability to support a variety of different communications services such as telephony, information services or video over the same physical network infrastructure challenges the existing communications law, which is based on the assumption that different physical infrastructures offer different communications services.  What can regulators and legislators do to allow the Internet to realize its economic, social, cultural, and political potential? How can we foster the deployment of more broadband networks? And how can policymakers allow applications like Internet telephony and traditional telephony to coexist without giving one an unfair advantage over the other? The course will address how current law deals with these questions, but also explore what regulators and legislators may do to better deal with the challenges posed by the Internet. The course is mostly focused on the US, but highlights developments elsewhere where appropriate.  Special Instructions: Students may take Communications Law: Internet and Telephony and Communications Law: Broadcast and Cable Television in any order (neither is a prerequisite for the other).

Top executives from these companies have testified before Congress about their role in spreading misinformation in the 2016 elections. With the increased scrutiny come diverse calls for change. They include asking the platforms to self-regulate, asking regulators to address the platforms' growing market power, or asking Congress to adopt laws regulating various aspects of the platforms' behavior.  The seminar explores the many ways in which Internet platforms shape free expression online and asks what public responsibilities these private companies do and should have. By interrogating the structural role that these companies play in society -- are they quasi-state actors? are they the press? are they monopolies? -- we will assess how the platforms contribute to (or possibly mitigate) key social problems. We will critically examine constitutional and statutory laws, like the First Amendment, CDA 230, and antitrust law to evaluate whether and how they facilitate or constrain possible solutions. And with the benefit of guest speakers from academia and policy sectors, we will draw our own conclusions about how to best ensure platform accountability.  tl;dr: If you want to work at a tech law firm, in-house at a tech company, in a regulatory position vis-a-vis the tech sector, or are generally interested in critical questions around the role of Internet platforms in society and their impact on free expression online, this class is for you.

Consequently, copyright law has far-reaching economic and cultural implications. In this seminar, we will consider the interests of some of the different groups affected by the copyright regime, including creators, technologists, audiences, institutions, and heirs. Course readings will cover copyright case law and scholarship; research on creative practices and relevant business models; the role of copyright law in innovation policy; and legal versus extralegal modes of protecting the fruits of creative labor. Throughout, we will assess the fairness, efficacy, and alignment of copyright protection and remedies available, to whom, when, and for what reasons. The course aims to deepen students' knowledge of copyright law and scholarship; to equip students to develop principled policy arguments about the scope of copyright protection; and to enable students to evaluate reforms and alternatives to copyright in light of how these might serve different entities in the copyright ecosystem.

Today the term is widely understood to encompass not only long-term efforts to simulate the kind of general intelligence humans reflect, but also fast-evolving technologies (such as elaborate convolutional neural networks leveraging vast amounts of data) increasingly affecting finance, transportation, health care, national security, advertising and social media, and a variety of other fields. Conceived for students with interest in law, business, public policy, design, and ethics, this highly interactive course surveys current and emerging legal and policy problems related to how law structures humanity's relationship to artificially-constructed intelligence.  To deepen students' understanding of current and medium-term problems in this area, the course explores definitions and foundational concepts associated with &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; likely directions for the evolution of AI, and different types of legally-relevant concerns raised by those developments and by the use of existing versions of AI.  We will consider distinct settings where regulation of AI is emerging as a challenge or topic of interest, including autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapons, AI in social media\/communications platforms, and systemic AI safety problems; doctrines and legal provisions relevant to the development, control, and deployment of AI such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation; the connection between the legal treatment of manufactured intelligence and related bodies of existing law, such as administrative law, torts, constitutional principles, criminal justice, and international law; and new legal arrangements that could affect the development and use of AI.  We will also cover topics associated with the development and design of AI as they relate to the legal system, such as measuring algorithmic bias and explainability of AI models.  Cross-cutting themes will include: how law affects the way important societal decisions are justified, the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings, the incorporation of multiple values into AI decision making frameworks, the interplay of norms and formal law, the technical complexities that may arise as society scales deployment of AI systems, and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change.  Note: The course is designed both for students who want a survey of the field and lack any technical knowledge, as well as for students who want to gain tools and ideas to deepen their existing interest or background in the topic. Students with longer-term interest in or experience with the subject are welcome to do a more technically-oriented paper or project in connection with this class. But technical knowledge or familiarity with AI is not a prerequisite, as various optional readings and some in-class material will help provide necessary background. Requirements: The course involves a mix of lectures, in-class activities, and student-led discussion and presentations. Requirements include attendance, participation in planning and conducting at least one student-led group presentation or discussion, two short 3-5 pp. response papers for other class sessions, and either an exam or a 25-30 pp. research paper.

Industries as far flung as finance, transportation, defense, and healthcare invest billions in the field. Patent filings for robotics and machine learning applications have surged. And policymakers are beginning to grapple with technologies once confined to the realm of computer science, such as predictive analytics and neural networks. AI's rise to prominence came thanks to a confluence of factors. Increased computing power, large-scale data collection, and advancements in machine learning---all accompanied by dramatic decreases in costs---have resulted in machines that now have the ability to exhibit complex &quot;intelligent&quot; behaviors. They can navigate in real-world environments, process natural language, diagnose illnesses, predict future events, and even conquer strategy games. These abilities, in turn, have allowed companies and governments to entrust machines with responsibilities once exclusively reserved for humans---including influencing hiring decisions, bail release conditions, loan considerations, medical treatment and police deployment. But with these great new powers, of course, come great new responsibilities. The first public deployments of AI have seen ample evidence of the technology's disruptive---and destructive---capabilities. AI-powered systems have killed and maimed, filled social networks with hate, and been accused of shaping the course of elections. And as the technology proliferates, its governance will increasingly fall upon lawyers involved in the design and development of new products, oversight bodies and government agencies. AI is the biggest addition to technology law and policy since the rise of the internet, and its influence spreads far beyond the tech sector. As such, those entering practice in a wide variety of fields need to understand AI from the ground up in order to competently assess and influence its policy, legal and product implications as deployments scale across industries in the coming years. This course is designed to teach precisely that. It seeks to equip students with an understanding of the basics of AI and machine learning systems by studying the implications of the technology along the design\/deployment continuum, moving from (1) system inputs (data collection) to (2) system design (engineering) and finally to (3) system outputs (product features). This input\/design\/output framework will be used throughout the course to survey substantive engineering, policy and legal issues arising at each of those key stages. In doing so, the course will span topics including privacy, bias, discrimination, intellectual property, torts, transparency and accountability. The course will also feature leading experts from a variety of AI disciplines and professional backgrounds. An important aspect of the course is gaining an understanding of the technical underpinnings of AI, which will be packaged in an easy-to-understand, introductory manner with no prior technical background required. The writing assignments will center on reflection papers on legal, regulatory and policy analysis of current issues involving AI. The course will be offered for two units of credit (H\/P\/R\/F). Grading will be determined by attendance, class participation and written assignments.

Soon we are likely to entrust management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems. The prospect of &quot;turning over the keys&quot; to increasingly autonomous systems raises many complex and troubling questions. How will society respond as versatile robots and machine-learning systems displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems are free of algorithmic bias and respect human ethical principles? What role will they play in our system of justice and the practice of law? How will they be used or abused in democratic societies and autocratic regimes? Will they alter the geopolitical balance of power, and change the nature of warfare?

Drawing on the lecturer's experience as General Counsel of Facebook, the course will focus on actual controversies that confront practicing lawyers as they grapple with these evolving issues in a fast-moving environment of innovation and disruption. In less than 15 years of existence (and less than seven years as a public company), Facebook has confronted an unending set of legal challenges, across the full range of subject matter, and in the process has helped define technology law in the 21st century. From questions of privacy law, to antitrust, to intellectual property law, to cutting-edge litigation, and most recently to election law and the political process, Facebook has been at the forefront of many of the defining legal developments of our era. In order to navigate these issues effectively, lawyers must combine legal expertise with practical business judgment as well as an understanding of the broader social and political context -- and in this course, students will develop those skills by studying Facebook legal controversies from the past and the present.

Designed as an accessible survey, the course will equip students with two powerful bases of knowledge:  (i) a working technical grasp of key digital technologies (e.g., AI and machine learning, internet structure, encryption, blockchain); and (ii) basic fluency in the key legal frameworks implicated by each (e.g., privacy, cybersecurity, anti-discrimination, free speech, torts, procedural fairness).  Substantively, the course will be organized into modules focused on distinct law-tech intersections, including:  platform regulation, speech, and intermediary liability; algorithmic bias and civil rights; autonomous systems, safety, and tort liability; &quot;smart&quot; contracting; data privacy and consumer protection; &quot;legal tech,&quot; litigation, and access to justice; government use of AI; and encryption and criminal procedure.  Each module will be explored via a mix of technical and legal instruction, case study discussions, in-class practical exercises, and guest speakers from industry, government, academe, and civil society.  Law students will emerge from the course with a basic understanding of core digital technologies and related legal frameworks and a roadmap of curricular and career pathways one might follow to pursue each area further.  Students from elsewhere in the University, from engineering to business to the social sciences and beyond, will emerge with an enhanced capacity to critically assess the legal and policy implications of new digital technologies and the ways society can work to ensure those technologies serve the public good.  All students will learn to work together across disciplinary divides to solve technical, legal, and practical problems.  There are no course prerequisites, and no prior legal or technical training will be assumed.  Students will be responsible for short discussion papers or a final paper.  After the term begins, students electing the final paper option can transfer from section 1 to section 2, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

This seminar will explore the diverse legal regimes regulating personal data--including privacy, property and security--and the imperfect nature of their protections.  Legal rules are rapidly evolving to address, if not resolve, the inevitable conflicts between privacy, property and security in relation to personal data.  Laws have been enacted and new ones are under consideration at the national, state and even municipal levels, as well as around the world.  Norms are emerging to guide these conflicts in the operation of business.  Technology is evolving that can facilitate the protection, or accelerate the exploitation, of personal data.  At the heart of all these developments is the question, who owns and controls personal data in the digital age.  The same piece of data may in different hands raise different expectations.  As an example, A may have a privacy expectation that her purchase from an online marketplace is no one's business but her own.  B, the app that served as intermediary between the buyer and seller, may have a property or contract expectation that it owns the metadata and other information about A's buying habits.  C, a government agency, may have a security interest in collecting or unearthing the details of A's purchase of particular items.  This same triad of interests is implicated across a wide variety of highly sensitive personal data, such as location information, facial recognition and medical results.  This seminar will explore these data rules, norms, technologies and conflicts through three sessions of lecture and interactive exercises addressed to privacy, property and security, respectively; four sessions devoted to presentations from leading representatives of consumer, corporate and government interests, with questioning by students in the class; and two sessions devoted to discussion of student answers to problem sets, focusing on an exploration of the privacy-property-security conflict and on forward-looking solutions to the protection of personal data.

We will consider discrete settings where regulation of AI is emerging as a challenge or topic of interest, among them:  autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapons, labor market decisions, AI in social media\/communications platforms, judicial and governmental decision-making, and systemic AI safety problems; the growing body of legal doctrines and policies relevant to the development and control of AI such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act; the connection between governance of manufactured intelligence and related bodies of law, such as administrative law, torts, constitutional principles, civil rights, criminal justice, and international law; and new legal and governance arrangements that could affect the development and use of AI.  We will also cover topics associated with the design and development of AI as they relate to law and governance, such as measuring algorithmic bias and explainability of AI models.  Cross-cutting themes will include: how law and policy affect the way important societal decisions are justified; the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings; the incorporation of multiple values into AI decision-making frameworks; the interplay of norms and formal law; technical complexities that may arise as society scales deployment of AI systems; AI's implications for transnational law and governance and geopolitics; and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change.  Note: The course is designed both for students who want a survey of the field and lack any technical knowledge, as well as students who want to gain tools and ideas to deepen their existing interest or technical background in the topic. Students with longer-term interest in or experience with the subject are welcome to do a more technically-oriented paper or project in connection with this class.  But technical knowledge or familiarity with AI is not a prerequisite, as various optional class sessions and readings as well as certain in-class material will help provide necessary background.  Requirements: The course involves a mix of lectures, practical exercises, and student-led discussion and presentations. Elements used in grading:  Requirements include attendance, participation in a student-led group presentation and a group-based practical exercise, two short 3-5 pp. response papers, and either an exam or research paper.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

It has diminished consumer choice, eroded innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy, weakened the vibrancy of the free and diverse press, and undermined Americans' privacy.&quot; The report included recommendations on restoring competition in the digital economy and strengthening antitrust laws and enforcement. The new Congress and the new Administration are expected to continue this work and advance proposals to reform the market.  This reading group will be devoted to an analysis of the state of online competition and potential remedies by studying the House report, as well as related actions and litigation. It will include deep dives into the specific allegations against Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, potential remedies as to each, and other potential reforms to further competition in digital markets.  The reading group will meet every other week starting in week 1 (i.e., weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) on Thursdays from 5 PM to 7 PM. It does not require an antitrust background, just interest in gaining a deeper understanding of the issues. Grading (MP\/R\/F) will be based on attendance and class participation.

Given their need to survive the current economic crisis, which will likely last for some time, foreign businesses--however guarded they are--must keep a watchful eye and be ready to seize opportunities arising from an economy that is too big to give up.  Designed to prepare students for different opportunities that are likely to touch on China and its regulatory framework, this introductory course examines Chinese legal rules and principles in select business-related areas, including intellectual property, dispute resolution (e.g., arbitration and litigation), foreign investment law, antimonopoly law, environmental protection, and artificial intelligence.  Drawing on her 25 years of experience handling issues related to U.S.--China relations, politics, and legal reforms, the instructor will, wherever appropriate, conduct discussions that help shed light on the role of China in the new world order.  Through active class participation and analysis of legal and business cases, students will learn both the law on the books and the law in action, as well as strategies that Chinese and international businesses alike can use to overcome limitations in the Chinese legal system.  Leaders from the law and business communities will be invited to share their experiences and insights.  This course is particularly suitable for law students, MBA students, and students enrolled in the East Asian Studies Program.  Undergraduates who have permission from the instructor may also take this course.  A Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration Form is available on the SLS Registrar's Office website.  Elements used in grading: class participation (20%), team project (40%), and extended take-home exam (40%).  For the team project component, students will work with another student enrolled in the class to produce an analysis of a judicial case or legislation in China and discuss, for example, the implications of the related Chinese legal principles for businesses and\/or major differences between these principles and similar U.S. legal principles.  Quality team projects may have the opportunity to be included in the professional journal published by the China Guiding Cases Project (&quot;CGCP&quot;), which is led by Dr. Mei Gechlik, the instructor, and her global team of nearly 200 members.  Team projects selected for publication will receive editorial input from the CGCP.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Extended Take-Home Exam","name":"AEXA","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXTENDED"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Comparative Law & International Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"COMP&INTL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Business Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"BUSLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1062,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Extended Take-Home Exam.

Over the past two decades, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon. In addition, new hybrid models and multilateral investigative institutions are in operation, attesting to the creativity of justice advocates. Meanwhile, national courts are increasingly exercising expanded forms of criminal jurisdiction over international and transnational crimes. The International Criminal Court (ICC) sits at the apex of this system, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency. Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria -- among others -- go unanswered. This course will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international justice and to the political environment in which this system is situated. Readings will map the once and future international criminal law institutions, offer an elemental analysis of international crimes and forms of responsibility as they have evolved in international law, and focus on the challenges of pursuing criminal prosecutions for international crimes. Jurisprudence from the various international and domestic tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof. The course will also engage new and perennial debates about the suitability of using criminal justice mechanisms to respond to mass atrocity situations and consider alternatives from the domain of transitional justice. In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, criminal law, and public international law.

Over 50% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers. Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States, including European human rights and fundamental rights protection standards. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues for breach of EU law as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts. Secondly, we will explore the legal framework governing business activities in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital, and persons (enterprises, workforce, immigration), including the legal and economic implications of Brexit, (b) EU competition (antitrust) law, and (c) the new digital European Internal Market and EU data protection and privacy laws. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU.

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Berkeley). Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare the written exchanges, to prepare for the live negotiations (as well as online negotiations in a world where these will be increasingly the norm), and to prepare for class discussions. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations; collective evaluation of the class's preparation for, and performance in, the negotiations; and the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. In addition to the regular Monday class, classes will meet for the live negotiations on one Thursday evening (DLA Palo Alto Office, 2000 University Avenue) at 7:00 PM-10:00 PM (10\/17), and four Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM (10\/3, 10\/10, 10\/17 and 11\/7) in the San Francisco office of DLA Piper (555 Mission Street; close to Montgomery St. BART station). The four Saturday classes will end at 1:30 PM, except for 11\/7 which will end at 2:30 PM.  Due to the Thursday and Saturday classes, this class will conclude on November 9. Admission to this class is by consent of instructor. The maximum class size is 21, which will include students from GSB or other departments. Attention Waitlist Students: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of their position on the waitlist and degree of study; all waitlist students are encouraged to attend the first class and will be notified as spaces become available. Attention Non-Law Students: You must complete and submit both a consent form and a Non-Law Student Course Add Request Form to the Law School Registrar's Office (Room 100). See Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration on the SLS Registrar's Office website. Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 7821) or comparable prior experience is recommended. Elements used in grading: Class participation, written assignments and final paper.

International commercial arbitration which has become the default means of settling international disputes and with clients increasingly involved in international business transactions and cross-border activity, is a rapidly growing practice area in law firms of every size. The practice is peripatetic, with many international arbitration lawyers basing themselves in law firms in New York, Washington D.C., Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major world commercial centers.  The course will deal with the internationalist elements of the subject matter, but also examine international commercial arbitration from an American perspective. Students can expect to review both foreign and US commentaries, statutes and case law. The course will comprise of five main topics: (1) an introduction to the field of international commercial arbitration; (2) the agreement to arbitrate; (3) the arbitrators; (4) the arbitration process; and (5) the arbitral award. The intent is to provide a strong academic understanding of the various theories and principles, but with a strong practical bent.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various strategic, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach examines the need for the parties to conflicts to address the following questions in order to have prospects of creating peaceful relationships: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? We will consider both particular conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the South African transition to majority rule, as well as cross-cutting issues, such as the role international legal rules play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, the ways intragroup dynamics affect intergroup conflict resolution efforts, and the role of transitional justice mechanisms to address atrocities following civil wars.

We will examine major sources of international human rights law---including treaties, customary international law, and national law---as well as the institutions in which human rights are contested, adjudicated, and enforced.  Key situses of human rights activity include multilateral organizations, like the United Nations Security Council and Human Rights Council; international, regional, and national courts and tribunals; and quasi-judicial treaty bodies, like the U.N. Committee Against Torture. This degree of jurisdictional redundancy offers an opportunity to explore questions of institutional design and interaction as well as processes of normative diffusion. The course will also consider the role of non-state actors---including non-governmental organizations, corporations, terrorist organizations, and ordinary individuals---in promoting and violating human rights.  In addition to this survey of the human rights ecosystem, the course will engage some of the fundamental theoretical debates underlying the international human rights project with a focus on perennial questions of legitimacy, justiciability, compliance, and efficacy. Finally, we will explore a range of threats and challenges to the promotion of human rights---both perennial and novel---including economic under-development, terrorism, national security over-reach, patriarchy, and racism. We will read case law originating from all over the world, including the United States.

Over the past decade, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon.  As these ad hoc institutions wind down, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has become fully functional, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency.  Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria---among others---go unanswered.  This intensive mini-course in the early September Term will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international criminal justice and to the political environment in which it operates. The classroom component (offered at Stanford during the first week of the course) will undertake an elemental analysis of international crimes as they have evolved in international law and focus on the challenges of interpreting these norms in a criminal prosecution.  Jurisprudence from the various international tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof.  The course will culminate in a visit to The Hague in the second week of the course, during which time students will meet with principals from the tribunals, including prosecutors, judges, administrators, and members of the defense bar.  In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, and public international law.  The course grade will be based on a series of short papers and active in-class engagement with the assigned materials.

We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system.

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at University of Vienna Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Vienna will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long-term supply contract, or some combination. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted in-person. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the professional and cultural dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party. Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. The course will be limited by consent to eight (8) students. Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 7821) or comparable prior experience is recommended. Elements used in grading: Class participation, written assignments and final paper. There will be two preparatory sessions at Stanford during February and March 2018. Students in the class will travel to Vienna on or before Saturday, March 24th. Class sessions will begin on Sunday afternoon, March 25, and continue all day Monday, March 26 through Wednesday, March 28th.

Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than others? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? How is the COVID pandemic affecting global poverty, and how should policymakers think about any potential tradeoffs? More generally, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is intended especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political\/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP\/R\/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H\/P\/R\/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from Section 01 into Section 02 with consent of the instructor. Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper.

Readings will provide the basis for short student reflection papers to be prepared in advance of each session. The class will generally involve an initial presentation, followed by seminar-style discussion.  Topics will include the human rights crisis facing Mexico, in particular, forced disappearances, summary executions and torture.  We will consider, for example, the forced disappearance of 43 students in September 2014 (Ayotzinapa) in at least one session.  The current political and human rights crisis facing Venezuela will be considered, likely by an expert guest speaker.  So too will the peace process in Colombia and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.  Other sessions will consider social conflict and justice issues across the region.  These issues will include the resurgence of populism in the United States and Latin America and its effects on social justice and human rights, the continued relevance of the Organization of American States and its human rights bodies, migration and human rights, the rights of indigenous and traditional peoples and models of development, among others.

The Course will consider issues of implementation, and the types of measures and forms of relief that can be sought from the Court and the Commission. The inter-American system has played a crucial role in opening spaces for debate on human rights protections in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing protections at the domestic level, and supporting civil society in its quest for accountability for massive human rights violations.  The system has also played a role in civil society efforts to bring the human rights debate home, including in the United States.  Students will have an opportunity to cast a comparative look at the inter-American and the European Human Rights systems and to consider the comparative advantages, disadvantages and complementary potential of regional human rights systems and universal international human rights and criminal justice bodies.

Yet it is also a means by which political communities protect themselves, pursue collective interests, and defend their rights.  When, if ever, is the recourse to armed force justified, either as a legal or moral matter?  And what rules, if any, do law and morality impose on the conduct of war?  The course explores both the international law regime and the just war theory principles governing war.  We will begin by considering when states may permissibly use force, and how changing security threats, including terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the impulse to respond to widespread humanitarian atrocities challenge and are reshaping the legal framework on recourse to force.  We will then explore the rules governing the conduct of warfare itself, including the constraints on the means and methods of war, the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants in armed conflict, and the rules governing the treatment of detainees.  A particular focus of the class will be the application of these rules in non-traditional, asymmetric conflicts between states and non-state armed groups.  Throughout, we will consider the relationship between just war theory and the international law regime governing the use of force, when they conform with one another and when they diverge, and why.

Enrollment in the class is currently closed.  South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994 marked the formal end of the comprehensive political, economic, and social system of racial subordination known as apartheid. The country has changed dramatically since then, as the government has built several million new housing units, created social welfare systems, and created an array of government and private sector programs to combat discrimination and redress the effects of subordination. Yet the country remains among the most unequal in the world, with 64% of black South Africans living below the poverty line, compared to 1% of whites. Most non-white South Africans receive poor education, live in substandard housing, and have limited employment opportunities.  In the last five years, discontent with the pace of economic and social transformation has boiled over. In 2015, university campuses erupted in protests. Students' demands quickly expanded from the removal of statutes of white colonizers to wider &quot;decolonization&quot; of university faculty and curricula and the expansion of access to higher education. &quot;Born-free&quot; student activists are now calling for faster, more radical transformation not just of campuses but of the society as a whole; many denounce what they see as the Mandela generation's overly conciliatory approach to white privilege in the economy, society, and interpersonal relations. Since 2018 there is new dynamism at the top, too: many South Africans believe that their new President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will curtail corruption and expand redistributive economic and social policies.  This course provides an opportunity to engage South Africa at this exciting historical moment, through intensive study during a week at Stanford and meetings with lawyers, activists, community members, and possibly students, journalists, and politicians during a week in Cape Town. We will focus on how lawyers are struggling for social justice and economic and social transformation--sometimes through ambitious arguments using South Africa's highly progressive constitution, but more often by supporting social movements day to day. Our learning will be grounded in specific cases, such as of the shackdwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo; Equal Education, an organization of high school-age students; and pioneering class actions on behalf of injured gold miners. These will enable us to explore various ways law and lawyers fit into social change, the challenges and rewards of such work, and how their perspectives overlap with and diverge from those of their clients. At the same time, we will draw connections between this work and the grand debates and historical arc described above. While comparing South Africa with the United States will not be a primary purpose of the course, we may well see interesting parallels and divergences, and will have some space to discuss those, among ourselves and perhaps with our South African interlocutors.  The format of the course will be unusual: We will return to campus before the Fall quarter and spend the week of September 9 preparing intensively at Stanford. We will meet daily for approximately three hours of discussion, collaborative exercises, and some lecturing, as well as read assigned material outside class. We will (a) learn some essential background on apartheid; current legal, political, economic, and social conditions; and our case studies; (b) begin to analyze legal activism methods and the challenges of transformation; and (c) prepare topics and specific questions for our meetings in South Africa, which students will lead. The following weekend we will fly to Cape Town, where we will spend the week of September 16 learning from visits to organizations and communities, and possibly one or two museums or other sites, as well as from discussions with a range of South Africans. We will return the weekend before the Fall quarter begins.  Stanford Law School is committed to equal access to field study courses regardless of financial situation. The School covers nearly all expenses during the trip, but students must pay for their own transportation to and from South Africa. Students who qualify for financial aid can receive a supplemental award to cover those transportation costs.  Elements use in grading:  The course grade will be based on a series of short papers (one or more of which may be due after our return), active in-class engagement with the assigned materials, and preparation for and participation in interviews during the trip, and. The course is open to rising 2Ls and 3Ls.

Although data suggests that there are places that accumulate more harmful practices than Latin American countries, Latin America is perceived as a champion of corruption. This macro vision may hide the distinctive characteristics of each country, as Latin America is a patchwork of idiosyncrasies regarding corruption. However, Latin American countries are narrowing their differences to closer patterns at a considerable pace. Latin America is facing an unprecedented chapter in its history against corruption due to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international organizations' recommendations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the US federal law that addresses accounting transparency requirements for companies that negotiate bonds in the US), and other constraints related to economic globalization. This course will present students with the theoretical literature that aims to explain corruption in Latin America, the technical constraints that have recently reshaped its practices, and the latest most significant cases. From the petty bribery that is essential for people to gain access to basic needs, to the sophisticated structure that is the mainstay of organized crime, corruption embodies an enormous range of different practices. Risk and uncertainty, information asymmetry, and contract enforceability are traditional barriers to the development of ethical business in Latin America in general. However, recent episodes in Latin America have demonstrated that corruption involving politicians and public procurement concretizes huge entry barriers to the free market. One of the aims of this course is to show how this kind of corruption is incorporated within the design of legal statutes and the practices of institutions. Some of the questions raised by this course will address issues including the following: what companies and institutions can do to improve fair trading in Latin America and stop the vicious cycle of corruption; how successful they might be considering Latin America's social and political environment; what challenges are introduced by the Foreign Corruption Practices Act; how political austerity in Latin America relates to the ability to inspect areas that are vulnerable to corruption and criminality; what the recent plea-bargain cases in Latin America, especially Brazil, show about hands-on experience with corruption; and how this knowledge can prepare lawyers to prevent their clients from falling into the same path-dependent dangers. The course is designed for JD candidates and LLM students, but graduate students from other departments are most welcome. Legal jargon is not expected. We will learn through seminar-style discussions and lectures. Elements used in grading are class participation, attendance, and a few reaction papers.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"polecon","organization":"LATINAM"}],"title":"Business, Institutions, and Corruption in Latin America","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2020-2021"},"420":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Comparative Law & International Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"COMP&INTL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"}],"code":"5042","course_id":222426,"description":"This is a course about the relationship between law and the larger society--but with readings drawn almost entirely from studies carried out in countries other than the United States.  The course will look, for examples, at readings from Chile, China, England, Germany, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Venezuela.  Introduction:  The aim of the seminar is to introduce students to studies of the relationship between law and society, but with an international and comparative perspective.  The readings use a broad range of methods and techniques, to explore how legal rules, processes and institutions are framed by, and influence, the social context.  Paying attention to the social context opens the door to a richer understanding of the law, a better explanation of what makes it work (or not work) and how it changes over time.  Traditionally the field called comparative law has concentrated heavily on differences between common law and civil law; and at principles and doctrines and formal rules.  But in the real world we know that systems can behave every differently even if they share formal rules and institutions.  Consider, for example, Canada and Jamaica, both common law countries; or Japan, Haiti and Spain --all civil law countries.  In many ways, the world today is a global village.  Lawyers, too, often work across borders.  It is the theory of the course that we can learn a lot about law and legal institutions, if we look at experiences in different countries:  plea bargaining in England; how victims of motorcycle accidents in Changmai, Thailand, deal with tort law; how the black market for used cars functioned in the former East Germany; the controversy over honor killings in Jordan; disputes over the sale of tunas in Tokyo's fish market; informal lending markets in Taiwan.  The aim is a more general understanding of how legal systems work, how structure and culture interact; and the role of lawyers, judges, courts, and institutions in different societies.  There are lessons to be learned about American society as well.  Methodology and evaluation:  The discussions in the classes will focus on a selection of readings from Law in Many Societies --a reader edited by Lawrence Friedman, Rogelio P&eacute;rez-Perdomo and Manuel G&oacute;mez (Stanford University Press, 2011). Other readings are contained in a package available to students in the class.  Some of the readings are classics in the field.  Others raise contemporary problems.  The course is a traditional seminar, in the sense that everyone in the seminar will be encouraged to speak, and to contribute to general discussion.  For each class, each student must write a short essay, reflecting on the readings (two or so pages at most or about 500 words).  These should be sent to both professors (lmf@stanford.edu &amp; rperez3@law.stanford.edu) and to fellow students, by email, not later than 24 hours before the class.  These reflection papers allow participants to tell us what aspects of the readings they found significant, and what they found right or wrong about the readings.  No footnotes or research are expected, and are, in fact, discouraged.  The reflection papers are required; but they are not graded.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  Automatic grading penalty waived for writers.  Elements used in grading:  The course grade will reflect class participation, and an extended take-home exam or a research paper at the end of the quarter.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Comparative Law & International Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"COMP&INTL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"R -Research Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"RESEARCH"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"}],"class_id":1224,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":2,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Comparative Law & International Law.

The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and weighs how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Ukraine, Hungary. The course is updated to include current events affecting state-building processes, including COVID, the regression of the rule of law, and the emergence of China. Elements used in grading:  Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the instructors, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP\/R\/F or an individual in-depth research paper or proposal, either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H\/P\/R\/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive EL credit or R credit. Automatic grading penalty waived for submission of the final work products.

The workshop will meet four times a quarter, and will be offered in most quarters.  Students may sign up for as many quarters they wish, and will receive one credit for each quarter they are enrolled. The bulk of time each session will be devoted to presentations of one or two student works-in-progress. Every student is expected to present her\/his own work at least once over the quarters she\/he is enrolled in the Workshop, and to provide constructive oral feedback on others' work. We will set aside some time during the quarter for informal discussion of research ideas that are in a very early stage.  We welcome students who are just starting to explore their interest in an academic career; if you have any questions about whether the course is suitable for you, please contact Prof. Barbara Fried (bfried@stanford.edu). Attendance is mandatory, absent extenuating circumstances. There are no written requirements for the course, and no requirement that the work presented be original to the Workshop. Students may wish to use the Workshop as an opportunity to expand on seminar papers or pursue independent research projects for which they are getting separate credit through one of the research tracks (e.g., directed research, dissertation). Whether students are working on a new project or revising an old, the expectation is that students will develop their topics independently of the course. Students who would like to participate in the Workshop but feel they need help in developing a workable research topic should consult faculty members ahead of time. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline. Classes will be held by Zoom, pending a loosening of COVID restrictions.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mandatory P\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":6,"max_units_repeat":6,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Legal Theory-Jurisprudence","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LGLTHRYJRI"}],"class_id":1081,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":16,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Classes will be held at Prof. Fried's home, health restrictions permitting.

In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, legal issues involving farm animals and animals in entertainment, and federal statutes regarding certain groups of animals. The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to legal concepts associated with animals in new ways. Students have called it a great bar review class, because concepts from many areas of law are covered with respect to their application to animals and their interests. More and more firms, large and small, are providing pro bono (and paying) work in the animal law area, as the field gains momentum and reputability in the legal community. Mr. Wagman is a lawyer in San Francisco, with a full-time animal law practice, representing organizations and individuals in a wide range of cases. He is one of the authors of the Animal Law casebook, two other animal legal texts, and has been practicing animal law for most of his 28-year career. His practice includes litigation, consultation, legislative work, and extensive writing and lecturing on various animal law topics. The class includes regular updates on his current cases, as well as real-life experiences from the front lines of the animal law frontier.

Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer meaning. Grading is based on class participation, two in-class moot court presentations, and, based on individual student preference, either a final exam (a one-day take-home essay with a word limit) or a final research paper.

And if so, how does it shape our understanding of, or the way we talk about, the law today? In many other academic disciplines, a central element of any course of advanced study is an encounter with a &quot;canon&quot; of some sort. This is a core set of texts that are perceived as foundational, and that are commonly used as reference points for scholarly advances. In other disciplines, the canon can be an object of emulation or criticism. Indeed, the very idea of a &quot;canon&quot; of legal scholarly is often subject to contestation, e.g., given the barriers women and minority scholars have faced.  Drawing on the model of those foundational courses in other disciplines, this seminar aims to provide students with a working knowledge of a set of scholarly writings that can plausibly be characterized as an American &quot;canon.&quot; At the same time, the seminar aims to elicit from students a critical engagement with this putative &quot;canon.&quot; Particular attention is paid to the manner in which the canon either includes or marginalizes certain voices. Hence, one part of the seminar involves reading material that might be part of an expanded, more diversely populated canon.  The seminar is designed for two kinds of student. First, it is a useful course of study for students either interested in academia or those thinking about whether academia might be the right path for them (and indeed, the seminar is modeled on a course at Chicago designed for prospective academics, or those considering that path).  Second, the course is a chance to take a deeper dive into ideas that lurk behind many first-course private-law and public-law courses.  During the seminar, students will read and discuss a range of texts, many drawn from Fisher and Kennedy's The Canon of American Legal Thought. Students will be asked to write response papers and to lead discussion on certain readings. The precise set-up of the course will depend, however, on enrollment. Finally, students will also have the option of doing a longer paper for additional credit (section 02).  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 (2 units) into section 02 (3 units) with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading: class participation, short papers, and optional final research paper. Paper extensions will be granted with instructor permission.

(Hopefully, you will learn particular advocacy skills if you will be an advocate; writing skills that will help you whether you draft contracts or legislation, briefs or executive summaries, client letters; and, particularly in the Experiential Learning courses,  skills that will help you exercise prudent judgment, collaborate with others, work both efficaciously and empathetically in a diverse world.).  The claim that underlies this course is that your &quot;classroom&quot; courses here at SLS -- and at pretty much any of the academically ambitious schools that most of you considered attending -- had both a text (the doctrines and policies in the particular subject area that you were studying) and a &quot;sub-text&quot; (the concepts and themes that recurred across a wide range, maybe all, of your courses.) The goal of this course is to highlight these recurring themes (and remind you or illuminate for you just how often you confronted or will confront these issues), to discuss more overtly and directly the distinct approaches to each of these recurring issues than you might have discussed them before, and to expose you to some ways of approaching these issues that might be less familiar to you. In discussing these issues, we will draw on the insights offered by a wide array of &quot;schools&quot; of legal thought, including, but not limited to, libertarianism, Law and Economics, Legal Realism, Critical Legal Studies, Critical Race Theory, a variety of Feminist Legal Theories (anti-subordination feminism, &quot;cultural&quot; feminism), Langdellian Formalism and neo-Formalism, Law and Society.  So, for instance, we will discuss some or all of the following issues: 1. Ways in which legal pronouncements are framed (the tension between the use of rules and standards; between default and mandatory rules); 2. Remedial options and remedial mechanisms (the choice between inalienable entitlements, injunctions, damages, restitution, and distinct forms of punishment; between sliding remedial scales and binary outcome-determinative rules; conduct regulation and output\/outcome goals; public enforcement v. mixed public\/private enforcement v. private enforcement with differing degrees of collectivization of individual complaints); 3. Issues in the interpretation of both private and public legal texts (textualism, intent-based originalism, flexible purposivism) and distinct theories of why or in what ways texts may be either incomplete or &quot;dated,&quot; with some special attention to how to interpret texts that appear to delegate authority (to another decision maker, to a future decision maker) to make narrow, concrete decisions; 4. The interplay between substance and procedure (and its relationship to creating a gap between the law on the books and the law in action; the degree to which substantive rules are framed in the way that they are because rule makers are anticipating procedural barriers to enforcing alternative rules); 5. Institutional competence issues; 6. Alternative visions of human behavior and motivation (individualistic rational choice models with &quot;thin,&quot; generally materialistic goals v. thicker rational choice models v. individualistic models influenced by psychologists, advancing richer views of how people process information and form tastes and\/or sociological models, focused more on group influence, group maintenance and group conflict); 7. Some recurring substantive issues (how we define operative assent and how we define normatively meaningful consent; how we deal with problems of incommensurable values or deny the possibility of incommensurability; when we do or don't believe people are adequately empowered by &quot;exit&quot; -- finding another provider in a market or subjecting ourselves to a different political body that will make the rules that govern us -- and when we believe power must be exercised politically\/collectively; when we believe principal\/agent problems are serious and how we think they are &quot;solved&quot;; battles between anti-classification and anti-subordination views of antidiscrimination norms) and 8. The origins of law and the impact of law (is law significantly autonomous or responsive to other social forces (where &quot;social forces&quot; might or might not be understood in significant part in terms of distinctions in power by race, class, gender, LGBTQ status etc.) and to the ideological predispositions of those who articulate it? Is law -- and most particularly the judge-made law we (over?) emphasize in law school -- effectual in achieving social change?)

The final segment of the course will involve a series of case studies, where students will test their knowledge of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and have the opportunity to see the course's themes echoed and expressed in recent real-world controversies. Importantly, though the course is nominally focused on &quot;the plaintiffs' lawyer,&quot; it does not just equip students to practice on one side of the &quot;v.&quot; Rather, through our grounded and contextualized study of legal ethics, advanced civil procedure, the legal profession, and contemporary legal practice, students will acquire tools to litigate cases of all stripes and for both sides.

But today, partners at the top tier of big corporate law firms -- &quot;big law&quot; -- are earning huge profits and job prospects for graduates of top law schools interested in the corporate sector are bright. Although some commentators continue to predict that demand for corporate legal services will contract in the mid- to long-term, it seems more likely that demand for high-end legal analysis will persist if not increase in the foreseeable future. The question is who (or what) is going to perform that work, in what organizational setting, with what technological assistance, and in what part of the world. This seminar will address the key dimensions of change in the &quot;big law&quot; market and how changes in the delivery of corporate legal services may affect legal careers, gender equality, diversity, and work-life balance. Topics include the increased power of Fortune 100 General Counsel, new organizational models for delivering corporate legal services, the response of large law firms to new market factors, the expanding role of information technology in the delivery of corporate legal services, third-party litigation financing, changing legal markets outside the US, the evolution of global law firms, the effects of changes in law firm organization on women and lawyers of color, and the effects of changes in the legal market on legal careers. Course materials will include books and journal articles, media reports, blog posts and guest lectures.  Special Instructions: You may write a series of short reaction papers on 4 of the topics we will cover at the seminar sessions. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a topic of your choice related to the evolution and future of Big Law.  This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors\/Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis. Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit (section 02), depending on the project. After the term begins, students registered in the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

These challenges existed in 2019, but 2020 has sharpened two of them.  The Covid-19 crisis has forced a change in the way lawyers work, with greater use of technology, and the resurgence of the #BlackLivesMatter movement following the death of George Floyd highlights the lack of diversity in the profession.  These developments add to existing economic and other pressures facing lawyers.  The specific topics covered will include: the changing relationship between in-house and outside counsel; ways that technology is changing the practice of law; new business models for lawyers, including the productization of legal services; and the challenges of diversity and inclusion in the profession. The course is a mix of full-class discussion with the instructors and guest speakers from practice, small-group discussion of case studies, and work on team projects.  A significant part of most classes will involve case studies where students will put themselves in the role of lawyers, and talk through options for dealing with the issues presented.  The instructors and guest speakers will introduce context about the challenges, and then engage students in thinking about possible paths forward.

These policy decisions range from the seemingly trivial, such as the size of holes in Swiss cheese, to matters of life-and-death importance, such as how to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These agencies also range in age, organization, and duties. There is the postal service, which was created over 200 years ago, and changed five decades ago from a cabinet-level department to a government corporation, with current calls to privatize it. On the newer side, there is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established in 2011 to protect consumers in the financial arena; its leadership and funding structure produced constitutional challenges that recently reached the Supreme Court. In this quarter of Administrative Law, we will consider the creation and control of the modern administrative state. Topics will include the structure of administrative agencies and their place in a governing scheme of separated but overlapping powers, delegation of authority to agencies, types and requirements of agency decisionmaking, availability and scope of judicial review of agency action (and inaction), and other forms of agency oversight. We will apply concepts through many recent examples.

Using a broad mix of case law, case studies, and scholarly analysis, this seminar will interrogate those attacks-including their historical roots, their theoretical justifications, and their practical effects. We will first study &quot;replacement reforms&quot;-attempts to jettison the common law in favor of alternative compensation mechanisms, including workers' compensation, auto no-fault, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, housed within the U.S. Court of Claims. Second, we will study modern tort reform initiatives, often dubbed &quot;discouragement reforms,&quot; which have chiseled away at damages and chilled personal injury victims' incentives and capacity to seek relief. Finally, we will study the United States Supreme Court's own tort reform activity, including recent jurisprudence limiting punitive damages, preferencing arbitration, and granting broad preemptive effect to agency actions. Through this analysis, students will develop a deeper and richer understanding of the tort system, its contemporary operation and excesses, and the uneasy but undeniably important place tort law-and civil litigation more generally-occupies in contemporary American society.

Rather than progressing seriatim through individual doctrines, this section of the regularly-offered course will focus on the role of the Fourteenth Amendment in the economy, education, personal autonomy, family formation, criminal justice, and voting. As a result, the course will pose many cross-cutting questions. For example, what are the various constitutional constraints on public education? What are the advantages and disadvantages of couching reproductive rights claims as due process claims versus equal protection claims? Do, or should, Fourteenth Amendment-based arguments operate differently within the criminal justice system? Using such questions, the course will work through established doctrines such as tiers of scrutiny, substantive due process, privileges and immunities, incorporation, state action, and congressional enforcement.  The course reader has been constructed to help you draw connections between topics and doctrines. Readings include formative Supreme Court cases on the contours of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as scholarly and popular media sources discussing its many applications. There will be no final examination. Instead, the written work for the course will consist of four short writing assignments (for a total of approximately 20 pages). Two assignments will ask you to compare doctrine across different areas of Fourteenth Amendment law through assigned case comparisons. The other two assignments, to be shared with the class as a whole, will ask you to apply insights from secondary sources (chosen from a list provided in the course materials) to the cases and issues we're discussing in class.

In considering this issue, we will address debates about constitutional interpretation (including both originalism and living constitutionalism), the nature and features of constitutional change within the American context, the role of federalism and the separation of powers in the constitutional scheme, and the nature of American constitutionalism as opposed to English and continental European models. We will tackle these debates in the context of some specific contemporary controversies about the Constitution, including: How do the civil rights movement and other social movements impact our understanding of the Constitution?; Does the Constitution reject a European-style inquisitorial process in favor of an Anglo-American vision of due process?; How important is consensus within the Supreme Court to establishing the legitimacy of constitutional meanings?; Why do we have nine Supreme Court justices, and; What is the Constitution, and how much does it include outside of the written document? Throughout we will be contemplating the extent to which our interpretation of the constitution depends on our vision of American democracy and the good society. Requirements for the course include regular class participation and either four response papers or a substantial research paper; students who take the research paper option will receive two or three units and 'R' credit.

We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues.  Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationship between ethics and culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion.  A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (e.g. Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devises (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Epi pen pricing, Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (e.g. NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid (Oxfam case)).  Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice. Attendance required. Class participation important (with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class).

An RJ framework observes that &quot;rights&quot; are given meaning -- and lose meaning -- according to the race, class, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, and physical and mental ability (among other attributes) of the rights bearer. As such, RJ analyzes reproductive experiences within a complex context and with respect to the multiple statuses of the persons involved.

Professor Lawrence Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, and several of the Law School's esteemed group of Supreme Court litigators are expected to participate in one or more of the sessions.  The 18 students in the seminar will be divided into two courts. During each sitting, one of the courts will hear arguments in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court, while two of the students from the court not sitting that week will present oral arguments. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix between criminal and civil cases.  Each student will be assigned the role of a particular Justice for the entire quarter.  Each student's task while sitting on cases is to do his or her best to understand that particular justice, based on that justice's prior opinions and judicial philosophy.  In this sense, the seminar is also intended to help promote insight into the role of judicial personality and philosophy within the decisional process.  The weekly seminars will proceed as follows: In preparation for each week's session, all students (whether they are the two students arguing that week, the nine students judging that week, or the seven students observing that week) will read the lower courts' decisions, the briefs (the party briefs and selected amicus briefs) and the major precedents implicated.  During the first portion of each week's session (approximately one hour), two of the students (who are members of the Court that is not sitting that week) will present oral arguments to the nine &quot;justices&quot; sitting that week. The arguments will be based on the briefs that were actually filed in the case.  During the second segment of each week's session (approximately 45 minutes), the &quot;justices&quot; who are sitting that week will &quot;conference&quot; the case while the other non-sitting students, students who argued, instructors and guests will observe.  Again, each student will be in the role of a particular justice.  At the end of the &quot;conference,&quot; the opinion-writing will be assigned to one &quot;justice&quot; in the majority and one &quot;justice&quot; in the dissent.  During the final portion of each session (approximately one hour), the instructors, guests and students will engage in a broad discussion of what they just observed.  This may include analysis of the briefing, discussion about the oral argument, reflections on the &quot;conference,&quot; and, more generally, a discussion about the case and its significance.  After each class, the student assigned to draft the majority opinion will have two weeks to circulate a draft to the &quot;Court.&quot;  The student writing the dissent will then have two weeks to circulate his or her opinion. The other sitting &quot;justices&quot; can join one of these opinions, request some changes as a condition of joining, or decide to write separately.  Over the course of the Quarter, then, each student will argue one case, sit on four or five cases, and draft at least one opinion.  Special instructions: 1. Because this is a simulation with assigned roles, students who are accepted into the seminar may not drop without permission of the instructor.  2. Because of the nature of the writing projects (with extensive interaction with other students), the normal deadline for Winter Quarter papers is waived and final papers must be submitted by the Spring Quarter deadline.  Elements used in grading:  Students will be graded based on the quality of their participation as justices, their oral argument, and their written opinions.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":7,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Public Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"PUBLLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":1125,"component":"SIM","curr_class_size":18,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigration. We will then turn to the trend toward austerity and retrenchment, and the effect of globalization for the future of the welfare state.  Course Requirements.  Participation\/Discussion (25%). Students are responsible to complete all readings and to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussion. Each student is responsible to lead a portion of the discussion twice per quarter.  Short Reaction Papers (25%). All students must complete 5 reaction papers related to the weekly readings of 2 to 3 pages in length. Reaction papers will include a list of questions to be addressed in that week's discussion. All reaction papers must be posted to coursework in advance of class so that the student(s) leading that week's discussion can incorporate the questions into that week's discussion.  Final Options (50%). Students have the option of completing one final paper of 20 pages in length OR 4 essays of 5 -6 pages each addressing the readings in weeks that the student did NOT complete reaction papers. Topics for 20 page papers must be approved by me in advance, and may be related to a student's dissertation or master's research or may be a stand-alone topic. Papers may take the form of a research proposal and need not contain original empirical research.

Seminar with Concurrent Policy Lab: Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures.  Policy Lab Client: National Women's Law Center:  Over the past six years, the issue of campus sexual assault has exploded into the public discourse. While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators, launching one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. Statistics are equally disturbing in the middle and high school context. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 250 colleges and universities currently under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints. At the same time, students accused of sexual assault have complained of botched processes driven by a &quot;campus rape over-correction&quot; that denied them a fair disciplinary hearing. It is clear that schools are struggling to develop and implement policies and procedures that satisfy their legal obligations in this area. While the future of federal enforcement under the Trump Administration is uncertain, schools are still subject to federal and state law that require them have policies and procedures to address sexual harassment and violence.  This course focuses on the legal and policy issues surrounding the highly challenging area of investigation and adjudication of sexual assault and other gender-motivated violence on college campuses and in K12 schools. It will cover the federal and state legal frameworks governing these procedures including Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Clery Act, and examine current cases as well as the rapidly-evolving legal, federal regulatory, and political environment surrounding this issue. Guest speakers working in the area will help to broaden the class's understanding of the subject matter. Students in this seminar will have the opportunity to participate in the invitation-only national conference entitled The Way Forward: Title IX Advocacy in the Trump Era, which will be held May 1-2 at Stanford Law School and is organized in conjunction with the National Women's Law Center. See [http:\/\/conferences.law.stanford.edu\/thewayforward-title9\/] for more information on the conference.  Concurrent Seminar and Policy Lab:  The seminar is taught concurrently with the Policy Lab (also entitled &quot;Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures&quot;). All students registered for the seminar participate in the Policy Lab, which works with the National Women's Law Center toward the development of a set of evidence-based and legally compliant model policies and procedures. Given all the controversy, surprisingly little is actually known about the policies and processes that are currently in use, nor is there any way of easily ascertaining what the majority of an institution's &quot;peer schools&quot; are doing with respect to solving a challenge or addressing an issue. There is no set of &quot;best practices&quot; to which school administrators can easily turn. Students will analyze cutting-edge issues related to school-based gender-motivated violence and work on a white paper for the NWLC that includes both legal and empirical research into the policies and procedures currently in use around the country. Throughout the class, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what they are learning and how it applies in a professional context. The eventual goal of this Policy Lab is the development in conjunction with NWLC of a free, web-based, open-source set of adaptable model policies and procedures that are targeted for different market segments (i.e., large private, large public, small private, HBCU, community colleges, and k12).  Course Schedule and Optional Travel:  The first three weeks of the class there will be two meetings per week, on Tuesday and Thursday from 4:15 to 6:15. Students will meet with Fatima Goss Graves, Senior Vice President for Program at the NWLC during week 2 to hear her expectations regarding the project and ask questions. During weeks 4-6 the class will meet once per week, on Thursday from 4:15-7:15 and small groups will work on their assigned sections of the project. On Thursday, May 4 (week 5), the class will meet with special guest Catherine Lhamon, former Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights and have the opportunity to discuss the project with her and receive her feedback. During Week 7, the class will take an optional trip to Washington DC to present the completed project to the staff of the NWLC on Friday May 19. The class will be housed at Stanford in Washington from Thursday May 18, and will attend a hearing of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the morning of May 19 and then present their project in the afternoon. Travel expenses (other than incidentals) are provided. On Saturday, May 20 we will have the option to meet with other policy makers and activists as well as sightsee (including an attempted visit to the National Museum of African American History). We will return to Stanford on Sunday May 21. There will be no class during week 8.  Enrollment, Assignments, and Evaluation; The Seminar and concurrent policy lab are both open to law students, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates. The seminar has two sections. Section 1 is a 2-hour seminar and students enrolling in Section 1 must also enroll in the Law 805R Policy Lab (1-hour). Section 2 is a 3-hour seminar, and students may enroll in that Section without concurrent enrollment in the Policy Lab. Regardless of the section of enrollment, all students will do the same assignments and be evaluated on the same criteria. All students will complete written work equivalent to a 26 page research paper. Law students will receive &quot;R&quot; credit for the seminar.

A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and\/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured &quot;public law&quot; litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity. In addition to examining these distinctive problem areas, we will look at broader, cross-cutting institutional reform proposals that have received recent attention.  Students in Section (01) will write three ten-page writing exercises on topics discussed in class.

Part II covers the expansion of the New Deal after World War II to new forms of welfare and regulation (such as Medicare and environmental law) and what we now call the Rights Revolution --movements of subordinated or marginalized groups to claim equal rights (African-Americans, women, the disabled, gays and lesbians) or fair treatment by government (criminal suspects, welfare recipients, mental patients, prisoners).

The seminar provides a general introduction to some of the laws governing children's sexual autonomy as well as necessary protections from sexual abuse; however, the seminar's primary purpose is to teach students about how the law discursively constructs children as it attempts to protect them.  Specifically, students will explore how laws designed to protect children from sexual exploitation also naturalize certain assumptions about children's perceptions, cognitive capacities, interests and vulnerabilities.  Our discussions will explore how the law, while attempting to catalogue and regulate the potential threats children face, also instantiates certain ideas about children's potential sex-related injuries and how these injures can affect them over time.  Finally, seminar discussions will explore whether there are any inconsistencies between the understanding of childhood, sexual injury, capacity, and autonomy in various areas of state child protection laws, federal constitutional law, and relevant federal statutes.  In addition to considering how laws regulating children's sexuality affect children, the seminar will also examine how the same laws effectively constrain adults' behavior, as well as shape our understanding of the role of certain social institutions. Laws intended to more generally protect children from sexual exploitation also regulate children's relationships to their parents, affect our understanding of the role of schools, and even our understanding of the role libraries and the internet play in educating citizens.  Seminar discussions will focus on how discursive constructs and social understandings about children contained in law both constrain and enable us in discussions of child sexuality.  We will also consider how these constructs and understandings empower certain institutions by legitimating certain kinds of intervention.

Multiple studies have reinforced the finding that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as approximately 10% of male students) experience sexual assault carried out through force or while the victim was incapacitated during their time in college. Fraternities have been found to be associated with an increased risk of female sexual assault on campus. Vulnerable students and those from marginalized groups are often found to be at increased risk. This is also a significant problem in k12 education. Sexual harassment rates are even higher. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by what they describe as an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators. These survivors have launched one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 300 colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints as of the end of that administration. At the same time, the Obama administration's heightened response led to a series of high-profile lawsuits by accused students who assert that they were falsely accused or subjected to mishandled investigations that lacked sufficient due process protections. The one thing that survivors and accused students appear to agree on is that colleges are not handling these matters appropriately and appeared to be more concerned with protection the institutional brand than with stopping rape or protecting student rights. Colleges have meanwhile complained of being whipsawed between survivors, accused students, interest groups, and enforcement authorities. In an about-face that many found shocking, the Trump Administration rescinded all of the Obama-era guidance on the subject of sexual harassment and has promulgated new proposed regulations that would offer significantly greater protection to accused students and to institutions and commensurately less protection to survivors. An increasingly partisan Congress has been unable to pass legislation addressing the issue.  It is unclear whether or to what extent the incoming Biden Administration will move to withdraw or amend the DeVos regulations. Meanwhile in schools have moved toward adopting an uneven patchwork of policies in which some schools cover conduct (for example, off campus conduct) that DeVos excluded from the purview of Title IX under the ambit of &quot;supplemental&quot; conduct policies and procedures setting up policy confusion and inequalities for students of different schools. This course focuses on the legal, policy, and political issues surrounding sexual assault and harassment on college campuses. Each week we will read, dissect, compare and critique a set of readings that include social science, history, literature, legal, policy, journalism, and narrative explorations of the topic of campus sexual assault. We will explore the history of gender-based violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for survivors in the educational context. We will also study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. We will critically explore the ways that responses to this violence have varied by the race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics of parties and institutions. We will hear from guest speakers who are actively involved in shaping policy and advocating in this area, including lawyers, activists, journalists, and policymakers. This year we will also host special guest speaker Chanel Miller, author of the bestselling memoir Know My Name. The subject matter of this course is sensitive, and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and\/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources and Title IX staff are available for those who need them. Elements used in grading: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers and a class presentation (section 01) or an independent research paper or project and class presentation (section 02). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 into section 02, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

These issues include: 1) immigration law reform and DACA, 2) the role of the Department of Justice in reforming local and federal criminal law enforcement, 3) the role of government policy in regulating the economy and financial system, in facilitating heath insurance, and in remedying economic inequality, 4) the proper balance between national security and civil liberties\/human rights, as exemplified by the debates over the status of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and drone warfare.  In each of these areas, and others, debates about law and policy had reached a seeming, or potential, consensus in early 2009, but that consensus quickly fell apart.  In each area, the gap between differing formulations of law and policy that had existed until recently has widened.  Keeping in mind the time limitations of this course, we will briefly examine most of these of law and policy -- the governing legal doctrines and policies, their evolution since 2009, and their present and future prospects.  The course will ask: What accounts for these differing visions of law and policy? What accounts for the inability of the political and legal system to resolve them?  What are the possible ways forward?  Class format will consist mainly of readings and class discussion, and students are encouraged to bring their own perspectives to bear on these difficult and timely issues.

More American adults than ever are unmarried; more than a third of those who do marry will divorce. Unprecedented numbers of children are now born to unmarried parents.

During the past half century their applicant pools have grown considerably--now including women, minorities, immigrants, and international students--while the sizes of their student bodies remain virtually unchanged. The broader social and economic context has shifted as well.  With globalization, the advance of technology and the resulting labor market shifts, advanced education is seen as more important than ever to getting ahead. Yet, even as elite universities seem central to Americans' hopes and dream, they have also come under attack, viewed as disconnected from, and alien to, &quot;regular Americans.&quot;  This course will engage these developments through considering a pivotal question:  How do and should elite educational institutions choose among the many applicants vying for admission? Two principles loom large in the ethos of selective college admissions: diversity and merit.  Throughout the course, we will take a critical stance toward these claims. For example, how much does and should merit shape admissions decisions?  What are the rationales for using prior grades and test scores to assess applicants?  Similarly, what are the costs and benefit of the diversity rationale? Should schools take account of race, socioeconomic class, or neither? Course readings will include judicial opinions and legal commentary, social science evidence and cultural criticism.

This first portion of the course will consider institutional-legitimacy issues facing the Senate, including the appointment of senators to fill vacancies as well as disputes concerning Senate rules and procedures such as the filibuster and holds. The second part of the course will explore how the Senate interfaces with the Constitution and the Supreme Court. It will examine how senators should regard the issue of constitutionality in voting on legislation, be it campaign-finance reform, internet decency, or health care. This part of the course will also consider how senators should approach proposed constitutional amendments. The final portion of the course will review the wide range of issues that have emerged in recent years regarding the constitutional relationship between the Senate and the Executive Branch, including the increasingly acrimonious issue of the standard to apply to executive appointments under the advice and consent power. Particular emphasis on this part of the course will be given to issues that have gained greater prominence since 9\/11, including the relationship between enacted, constitutional legislation and the presidential assertion of Article II powers, as well as the Senate's abdication of its Article I war-declaration power.

The goal is to identify strategies and mechanisms for future reform that would further the protections of non-citizens during a period of global hostility to migrants. One significant part of the course will be contributing to a project that tracks and catalogues all the immigration policy changes of the Trump administration. Students will also develop proposals for future non-legislative reform through administrative action.  The seminar will examine the federal administrative process from a theoretical, doctrinal, and practical perspective based on selected readings, guest speakers, and the instructor's experience as senior immigration policy advisor in the Obama administration at the Department of Homeland Security and as founder and former director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project.

The principal focus will be on Article V of the Constiution but we will also briefly examine the way in which the Constitution is said by some to be &quot;amendable&quot; (and to have already been &quot;amended&quot;) through alternate means apart from Article V. The seminar will enable students both critically to evaluate the myriad aspects of constitutional amendments and conventions using proper source material and to develop their own proposals for potential amendments.  The first part of the course will first explore the origins of Article V, including background on the comparative amendability of other written constitutions, the adoption of the Bill of Rights, and the apparent unamendability of the provision in Article V requiring equal representation of the states in the Senate.  We will then review the history of efforts--both successful and unsuccessful--to amend the Constitution, such as the early corrective amendments to the post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments, the Progressive Era amendments (e.g., the switch to the direct election of Senators), and the modern voting-related amendments. This section will also consider views about when and how it is proper or &quot;appropriate&quot; to amend the Constitution, the standard that members of Congress should employ in voting on proposed amendments, and the history of calls for constitutional conventions to amend the Constitution.  The second part of the course will explore the current possibility of a constitutional convention or conventions being called independently of Congressional initiative including the question of whether the scope of such a convention could be limited. We will then examine the relatively recent and current proposals and advocacy for and against constitutional amendments across the political spectrum. For this portion of the course, we will particularly consider the balanced budget amendment, the state veto amendment,  the victims' rights amendment, and the elimination of the direct election of Senators, from the conservative side of that spectrum. We will then particularly highlight the movement to overturn Citizens United by amendment, the elimination of the electoral college amendment, the proposal to overturn Heller (right to bear arms) by amendment, and the current effort to revive and ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, all mostly associated with the progressive or liberal side of the spectrum.  For the final seminar, students will be asked to give in class their opinion of Article V and whether it is too easy or difficult (or just right) in terms of allowing amendments. Each student will also be asked briefly to propose and defend an amendment that that student believes should be added to the Constitution.

The law used to be much simpler than it is today.  The law treated marriage as the near exclusive setting for the rearing of children, defining the woman who gave birth to the child was the mother, and the man to whom she was married as the father.  In recent decades, that simple legal principle has collapsed under the weight of social and technological change. The central social change is the reconfiguration of marriage and the multiplicity of settings in which children are raised. The advent of same sex marriage and same sex couples undermine longstanding assumptions about the legal definition of parent. And the fact that 4 in every 10 children are born to unmarried couples, and that nearly half of all married couples will divorce (often with either or both partners remarrying) introduce a dizzying array of possible family configurations.  Advances in genetic testing complicate matters further, by allowing biological parents to be identified with near certainty. Thus, there is less reason to treat a woman's husband as her child's father. Many couples use reproductive technologies involving the donation of sperm, the donation of eggs or even the use of a surrogate mother to gestate the child. The use of such technologies can result in many adults having some form of tie to the child, a situation that has prompted some jurisdictions to recognize the possibilities of more than 2 parents!  In sum, nonmarital, nonbiological, and same-sex parenting have become central, rather than peripheral features of the familial landscape. These changes highlight provocative and fundamental inquiries: What, exactly, does, and should, make one a parent in the view of the law? And how should the state allocate rights and responsibilities, related to custody, financial support and visitation, as families fracture and reconfigure?

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the prosecution of Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet; Argentina's reparations to victims of its military regime; and the International Criminal Court are among the best-known policy responses to those problems. In addition, non-legal interventions---such as the Berlin Holocaust Memorial and Nelson Mandela's many symbolic gestures toward reconciliation with white South Africans---may have important social and political effects. In addition to initiatives at the national and international levels, we will devote some attention to transitional justice at the local level.

But the operative term, &quot;discrimination,&quot; is typically quite vaguely defined in statutory language.  As a consequence, courts and legal analysts have developed a number of theories of discrimination.  These theories can be inconsistent with each other and with popular definitions of discrimination; for instance, some laws forbidding &quot;discrimination&quot; forbid differential treatment, some permit it under limited circumstances and some require it.  Discrimination may or not require a specific mental state (&quot;discriminatory intent&quot;) or specific consequences (&quot;discriminatory effect&quot; or &quot;disparate impact&quot;).  Arguably, &quot;discrimination&quot; is, in practice, as much a question of values and norms as it is a matter of fact.  This class will explore the concept of discrimination in case law, philosophy and legal theory.

Historically, family law had two main functions. It created a framework for bearing and raising children, and organized the children's parents' coupledom. Gender, sexuality and reproduction were closely interwoven and subject to certain expectations. Sex was only allowed in the context of marriage, which formed the gateway to reproduction. Children born outside of wedlock had inferior rights. Women were placed under their husband's control to ensure their sexual fidelity.  From the 1960's on, societal changes shook the traditional conception of the family to its foundations. Women gained economic independence and started challenging their traditional role in the family. Birth control cut the ties between sexuality and reproduction. The position of marriage as the sole seat of both coupledom and childbearing started to erode. The disconnection of gender, sexuality and reproduction opened family law up to new questions. Why should marriage only be possible between a man and a woman? Can children have more than two legal parents? What is the extent of the reproductive rights of women and men? Is marriage still a relevant legal concept?  These and other questions are tackled from a comparative law angle, comparing the approach in the United States and other Western jurisdictions. Students are asked to reflect on the various responses to contemporary family law issues across the Western world. The focus is on general tendencies, not on technicalities. Grades will be based on regular attendance, active class participation and one short response paper.  This class will meet the first three weeks of the quarter on Thursday, January 9, 16, and 23.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":1,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[],"title":"Gender, Sexuality and Reproduction","units_max":1,"units_min":1,"year":"2020-2021"},"536":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Public Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"PUBLLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"}],"code":"7092","course_id":221195,"description":"The law is in large part about suffering.

Opinions about issues ranging from antidiscrimination law, criminal justice, education, poverty, and inequality to gun policy, environmental law, the challenge of climate change, the provision of medical care, national defense, and the need to thwart or respond to pandemics, asteroids, or other rare but potentially catastrophic events are rooted in conceptions of the proper role of government and empirical assessments about its capacities and the benefits and costs from government action or inaction. Based on the course readings and our discussions, those supporting a more limited role of government will be pushed to defend this position and articulate its possible risks and benefits. Those supporting a more activist approach will be pushed to prioritize their programmatic preferences in light of our inherently limited capacity to advance every objective and address every possible problem or threat.

Materials will primarily be original source texts, supplemented by selected secondary literature. The majority of class time will be devoted to discussion, based on close reading of the materials. Students will be assigned to take the lead on class discussion on particular topics. Topics will include: (1) the constitutional status of slavery prior to the Civil War; (2) the Emancipation Proclamation; (3) the Thirteenth Amendment; (4) the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and President Johnson's constitutional veto; (4) drafting and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, with special emphasis on the citizenship clause, due process, equal protection, privileges and immunities, and congressional enforcement; (5) the Freedman's Bureau Act, Ku Klux Klan Act, Enforcement Acts, and Civil Rights Act of 1871; (6) the Fifteenth Amendment; (7) the Civil Rights Act of 1875; (8) early Supreme Court interpretations, and (9) the collapse of Reconstruction and rise of Jim Crow. Within these topics, we will discuss segregation, affirmative action, the state action doctrine, equality with respect to non-racial characteristics, ratification rules, state sovereign immunity, and the role of electoral politics in constitutional interpretation and enforcement. Note: This is NOT a course on current interpretations of the Reconstruction Amendments, but on their historical background.  There are no prerequisites. First year law students and non-law students are welcome. Constitutional Law would be helpful but is not required.  Grading. Grades will be based partly (20%) on class participation, and partly on either an in-class exam or a research paper on a topic approved in advance by the instructor. Students will choose between the exam and the paper. Grades for students will be on the Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail system.

Our safety net is intended to provide a floor to prevent poverty and destitution, to support workers and their families when work is not available either due to the economy or to personal circumstances, and it is intended to also provide for basic human needs such as food, medicine and shelter. The COVID-19 induced recession with millions of lost jobs, lost wages and severe global economic disruption provided the greatest stress test to our modern safety net.  This seminar will examine the structure, law and policies of America's social insurance system and safety net. We will examine these social programs through a combination of theoretical readings, court cases, practical policy proposals, and lessons learned from how the system worked or failed during the great stress test provided by COVID-19 and the ensuing recession. The course aims to spur critical thinking about the proper role of government in protecting against certain risks, as well as the appropriate target of the government's interventions. The course will also consider how the changing nature of work, family, technology and the private sector has played in disrupting the existing social safety net and what considerations should be taken into account to strengthen and build the next generation social safety net in America.

By the 1990s, social scientists had already built a massive literature on this topic, and an integrative consensus theoretical framework began to emerge.  But in the past decade, this literature has been revitalized by dramatic new ideas and technologies, as well as significant improvements in evaluation methodology.  We will focus on four types of strategies that apply equally to influence efforts by individuals, communities, non-profits, for-profits, and government: (1) Carrots: Positive incentives (rewards, awards, praise, recognition, discounts, rebates, property rights, etc.); (2) Sticks: Negative incentives (punishments, fines, shaming, guilt or liability verdicts, costs, etc.); (3) Norms: What other people believe I should do, and what I see others actually do (tipping points, bandwagons, cascades, herding, etc.); and (4) Nudges: Traditional methods of persuasion; use of defaults to encourage certain behaviors; engineering the environment; harm reduction for risky behaviors.  We will examine the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; and &quot;when&quot; of these approaches, but also their normative implications for ethics, justice, and public welfare.  Course requirements include class attendance and participation, and five short written assignments. For Research &quot;R&quot; credit, students may petition to complete one long paper based on independent research.

We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs. There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this course, though some prior training in economics will be helpful.

Representative of these sessions have been discussions of compensation for government regulations and takings, liability rules for controlling accidents, the definition of markets in antitrust analysis, the role of the government as a controlling shareholder, and optimal drug patent length. Special Instructions: You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a law and economics topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors\/Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis. (You may write a single longer paper for two quarters if you enroll in the Seminar in the Autumn as well.) Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit, depending on the paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in economics. Students may take both Law and Economics Seminar I and Law and Economics Seminar II in either order (neither is a prerequisite for the other). Elements used in grading: Four commentaries or one research paper. Cross-listed with Economics (ECON 354).

The popular image of an empirical study is that it involves sophisticated statistical analysis of quantitative data. Often the author of the study starts with a handy dataset and then tries to figure out what question he or she can answer using those data.  Useful empirical studies of law and other topics don't start this way. Instead the researcher has a question, derived from theoretical literature or policy debate (or both) and faces the challenge of deciding what types of empirical data, collected and analyzed in what fashion, will best answer that question. The possibilities range from &quot;big data&quot; analyses of hundreds or thousands of documents, tweets or something similar to lengthy, intensive interviews with a few well-placed officials or informants, with just about any other way one might collect factual data --  e.g. online surveys, courtroom observations -- in between. What all of these approaches have in common is not that they involve numeric data but that they attempt to arrive at as objective a view of social, economic, or political reality as is possible.  Learning how to design and conduct a survey or how to estimate a regression model or apply AI to vast numbers of texts is (relatively speaking) easy. There are lots of courses at Stanford that you can take on these methods. Learning what approaches are most appropriate to answer the research questions you are interested in is much harder. This seminar is directed at helping you think through the design of an empirical research project -- whether quantitative, qualitative or both -- from identifying researchable questions to collecting and analyzing data to presenting your results to academic or policy audiences. You will start with a broad question (or several questions) of interest to you, based on your previous experience, other studies or reading. By the end of the seminar you will have identified questions you can investigate empirically (perhaps in addition to theoretically) and figured out what research approach(es) will work best for you. The product of the seminar will be a preliminary research proposal, whether for your master's thesis this year or some other purpose in the future.  Although plans for the fall quarter are still somewhat in flux, I expect to teach this seminar online with the assistance of the SPILS teaching fellow. I hope it will be possible to meet in person at the beginning of the quarter for a few introductory sessions to begin to get to know each other. In any event, I will be available throughout the quarter for one-on-one zoom sessions to discuss your research.  Special Instructions: JD students can take the class with consent of the instructor.  After the term begins, JD students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which can potentially satisfy the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Traditional empirical legal scholarship uses methods such as observational studies and experiments to examine the effects of various policies or legal decisions. More recently, advancements in technology have given rise to a new strand of research that uses tools such as machine learning and natural language processing to study legally relevant datasets at a large scale (&quot;Big Data&quot;). This seminar will present a range of topics that highlight current empirical legal scholarship in these areas. A theme of the course will be comparing and contrasting traditional empirical approaches with the techniques emerging from machine learning and big data.  During roughly half of the sessions, we will host a guest speaker who will present an ongoing empirical research project. Familiarity with data science or statistics is not required.  Special Instructions: You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single empirical research paper on a legal topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement.

Lawyers often lead the design and implementation of these conflict resolution systems. Increasingly these systems utilize technology to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency for disputants.

Group functionality and outcomes can be significantly improved by any group member who has the awareness and skills of a facilitator, whether or not that person is formally designated as the facilitator.

Mediation has become the preferred approach to conflict resolution in most states and many parts of the world. With the assistance of a mediator, parties can reach agreements at any stage in a dispute, in some cases avoiding litigation altogether, in other cases agreeing just before trial or when the case is on appeal. The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the oral and written communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to practice all of the phases of a mediation and appropriate use of caucus, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation. The class methodology is highly experiential, with more than half of the class consisting of practice from the perspective of client, advocate and mediator. The course also includes readings and discussions, brief interactive lectures, demonstrations and videotaped sessions. Each student receives individual feedback from an experienced Bay Area mediator and develops skills that will be useful in client development, interviewing, counseling, fact development and legal analysis, negotiation and a variety of contexts beyond mediation.

Autumn term will be dedicated to brief writing and completion of the written portion of the Competition; the oral argument portion of the Competition will be conducted during the first four to five weeks of Winter term. Students on externship and in clinics may enroll, if permitted by their respective programs. In Autumn term there are only a few class meetings, including a guest lecture on ethics, which can be recorded. In addition, there are individually scheduled conferences. In Winter term, there are optional class meetings and practice arguments. Participation in the oral argument competition is mandatory, which includes attendance at the semifinal and final arguments. The preliminary rounds are held in the evening; the semifinal and final rounds are in the late afternoon. Prior to the Competition itself, materials and lectures are provided on research, brief writing, and oral advocacy techniques. Registration for the Kirkwood Competition is by team. Each team is required to submit an appellate brief of substantial length and quality and to complete at least two oral arguments, one on each side of an actual case. The first draft of the brief is reviewed and critiqued by the course instructors. The course instructors and the Moot Court Board Presidents score the final draft of the brief. The course also offers digital recording and critiques of practice oral arguments. Panels of judges and local attorneys serve as judges who score the oral argument portion of the Competition. Teams are selected for the quarterfinal, semifinal, and final round of the Competition based on their brief and oral advocacy scores. The final round of the Competition is held before a panel of distinguished judges, and the entire Law School community is invited to attend. Special Instructions: In order to maintain academic standards, enrollment in the Kirkwood Competition is limited to 20 two-person teams. This limit will be strictly enforced. Registration forms will be distributed Spring term. If the program is oversubscribed, a lottery will be held to determine participating teams and to establish a waiting list. The final drop deadline for the course will be on Thursday of the first week of classes. Enrollment in both Autumn (2 units) and Winter (1 unit) terms is required. The final grade for both Autumn and Winter terms and the Professional Skills credit will be awarded upon the completion of the course requirements.

Autumn term will be dedicated to brief writing and completion of the written portion of the Competition; the oral argument portion of the Competition will be conducted during the first four to five weeks of Winter term. Students on externship and in clinics may enroll, if permitted by their respective programs. In Autumn term there are only a few class meetings, including a guest lecture on ethics, which can be recorded. In addition, there are individually scheduled conferences. In Winter term, there are optional class meetings and practice arguments. Participation in the oral argument competition is mandatory, which includes attendance at the semifinal and final arguments. The preliminary rounds are held in the evening; the semifinal and final rounds are in the late afternoon. Prior to the Competition itself, materials and lectures are provided on research, brief writing, and oral advocacy techniques. Registration for the Kirkwood Competition is by team. Each team is required to submit an appellate brief of substantial length and quality and to complete at least two oral arguments, one on each side of an actual case. The first draft of the brief is reviewed and critiqued by the course instructors. The course instructors and the Moot Court Board Presidents score the final draft of the brief. The course also offers digital recording and critiques of practice oral arguments. Panels of judges and local attorneys serve as judges who score the oral argument portion of the Competition. Teams are selected for the quarterfinal, semifinal, and final round of the Competition based on their brief and oral advocacy scores. The final round of the Competition is held before a panel of distinguished judges, and the entire Law School community is invited to attend. Special Instructions: In order to maintain academic standards, enrollment in the Kirkwood Competition is limited to 20 two-person teams. This limit will be strictly enforced. Registration forms will be distributed Spring term. If the program is oversubscribed, a lottery will be held to determine participating teams and to establish a waiting list. The final drop deadline for the course will be on Thursday of the first week of classes. Enrollment in both Autumn (2 units) and Winter (1 unit) terms is required. The final grade for both Autumn and Winter terms and the Professional Skills credit will be awarded upon the completion of the course requirements.

You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your paralegal, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory (including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact analysis, legal analysis, and collaboration), you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system. The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required. Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the instructor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class.

We will learn by doing.  The course emphasizes experiential learning and negotiation simulations, as well as case studies and engaging directly with professionals in the field.  Students will have opportunities to reflect on their experiences, provide one another with direct feedback, and receive feedback from instructors and expert guest speakers.  The course focuses on conflict settings in the international arena (including natural resource management and extractive industries, ceasefire negotiations, and peace agreements), but students will develop skills to help them be effective in any complex negotiation setting from their local communities to the workplace. The course is designed for students who have already taken Basic Negotiation, but students who have not taken Basic Negotiation may still be admitted if they attend an intensive bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods the first Saturday of spring quarter.  This course is open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs.  SPILS students and International Policy Studies students are especially encouraged to enroll.

The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze (in terms of law and facts), prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations, including ethical responsibilities to the client and the public, opportunities for leadership, and collaboration. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active preparation and participation, submission of four assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a selected case analysis (a completed or ongoing environmental policy dialogue).

The instructor will provide the written briefs, and each week half the class will argue and half the class will judge a motion. Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence. Thus, while the context of the course is litigation, the objectives are much broader than the mastery of litigation technique. This course is not open to first year Law School students.

This lawyering skills course gives students an orientation to and constant practice in most basic pretrial and trial advocacy skills areas. Topics include: taking and defending depositions, trial evidence, including admission of trial exhibits in evidence and use of prior witness statements to refresh and impeach a witness, jury selection and voir dire, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses, and closing arguments. Students will try a full case through to verdict before a federal or state judge at the end of the course. There will be two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 PM, plus the final weekend of trials, Saturday and Sunday November 14 and 15. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end before 9:00 PM. For details, please refer to the 2020 Trial Advocacy Workshop Schedule at https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/TrialAd2020. The format for each topic begins with a lecture\/discussion featuring video vignettes of various techniques and a demonstration by an expert trial lawyer. Following the discussion portion of each topic are small group sessions during which each student practices the skills involved. Constructive feedback is given after each exercise by two of our faculty of very experienced Bay Area litigators and judges. Many exercises are also videoed for further one-on-one critique by another faculty member. The central philosophy of the workshop is that skills are best acquired in an experiential manner by seeing, hearing, and doing. Frequent short, well-defined exercises followed by immediate constructive feedback in a non-competitive, non-threatening atmosphere provide the core of the program. The workshop directors are Tim Hallahan, Judge Sallie Kim and Sara Peters. Tim has taught similar programs at Harvard Law School, the University of San Francisco School of Law, Berkeley Law, the California Continuing Education of the Bar, and in private and public interest law firms around the country. Sallie is a United States Magistrate Judge in San Francisco and was a partner in a civil litigation firm and also previously taught a class at SLS and served as Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Sara is a trial attorney for a personal injury law firm in San Francisco. She graduated from Stanford Law School in 2008 and coaches the Stanford Law School Mock Trial Team. Special Instructions: If you haven't taken Evidence you must contact Tim Hallahan before the course begins for some brief pre-course reading assignments. There are no papers or tests, but attendance at every session is required. Since we will begin our trial advocacy exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Mandatory attendance.

Students will also be given homework assignments, including grammar exercises, to assist students with Spanish mastery. Class instruction will take place predominantly in the Spanish language. The course is designed to be beneficial for students with varying levels of Spanish language ability, up to and including students who are native speakers of Spanish.

They will answer the question: how do we make our social legal systems better for people -- and how do we put people at the center of this redesign? The seminar has two parallel components: (1) Learn from a series of experts who have been taking a community-led approach to remaking a legal system (or analogous ones). Guest experts will present their current case studies to illustrate strategy and process design. (2) Select one of two system redesign challenges (see below) and develop their own prototype launching workshop.  [For those students interested in continuing with the project, there will be a companion policy lab in the Spring Quarter 2018. This seminar is a prerequesite for the policy lab.] The two prospective system-leader partners are on the verge of major new overhauls of their current systems: (a) California Self-Help Services' guardianship\/kid's custody redesign, with Bonnie Hough and the California Judicial Council as a partner, as they try to figure out how to remake the legal system for parents and family members (without lawyers) trying to get custody worked out for kids. (b) New York Chief Justice Task Force housing court\/eviction redesign, with the Chief Judge Janet DiFiore's task force as the partner, as they try to figure out how to make the eviction system work better for users.  Students will develop their own preliminary plan and prototype for a user-centered process for their partner. Students will learn about new approaches to policy-change, as well as the fundamentals of participatory design and community lawyering. They will operationalize these different approaches, to make them relevant and actionable in an actual legal system. They must synthesize a recommendation to their partner-leader about how they might create a better process to redesign a given court process\/system. And they must create a prototype of a launching workshop, that can demonstrate how a wider process would work, while also testing their plan.

The course will help students gain facility with basic policy methods and approaches common to public policy research and Policy Lab projects. The core session of the course consists of three hours of classroom instruction on a Saturday morning (the Saturday at the end of the first week of classes) with emphasis on thinking like a policy analyst (as distinguished from an advocate or lawyer), scoping policy problems, promoting and assessing evidence quality, and making valid (and avoiding invalid) inferences. The afternoon session offers three hours of instruction focused on designing and evaluating programs to improve individuals' lives (for example programs aimed at reducing homelessness or opioid addiction). Then, during the early part of the term, students may choose at least two topics from among a series of short workshops including (1) interviewing clients and other stakeholders (especially where ethnic and cultural differences may be salient), (2) policy research tools and strategies, (3) design thinking for law and policy, (4) charting, graphing, and visualizing data, and (5) policy writing.  With guidance from their faculty instructors, students may then draw on the skills developed in this introductory seminar to analyze a public policy problem, develop potential strategies to address it, weigh the pros and cons of strategy options, and produce a final product that may offer options or recommendations to a policy client, suggestions for implementing such recommendations, and techniques to assess the effectiveness of implementation.

We will examine the role of nonviolent direct action, negotiation and mediation in a variety of historical, present-day and simulated cases in order to identify and analyze strategic lessons from successes as well as failures.  We will inquire into the relationship between direct action campaigns, and legal processes and political decision-making.  After examining transformative campaigns led by Gandhi, King, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, we will explore case studies such as the anti-apartheid movement, and truth and reconciliation process, in South Africa; and racial and environmental justice movements and anti-gun violence campaigns in the United States in recent years until the present day, including Black Lives Matter, March for Our Lives, and the fossil fuel divestiture movement.  Students will participate in several simulated negotiation and mediation exercises to develop experiential learning in the field from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including activists, community leaders and government officials.  In several sessions we will engage in dialogue with leading scholars and activists of transformative nonviolence, and we will engage together in a nonviolence training workshop.  Students will have an option to enroll in an R-paper section with the permission of the instructor.

Should I do litigation or transactional work, such as public finance, whatever that is? Should I become a prosecutor or a public defender or criminal defense attorney? Should I go in-house and in what size place? Should I leave the law behind and pursue business or other opportunities? Those are not the only questions. To add an overlay that we all must address directly or indirectly, how is my being a person of color relevant to my decision and my success? In a world in which diversity is said to matter, as a person who is not of color, should I take that into account? What about being a woman or LGBTQ in the workplace? Or, what about being a woman or man who wishes to have a family? How does that (or should that) impact my decision? These are just some of the issues that will be explored. They will be explored each week in classes lead by different guests who will be law school graduates practicing law at law firms as associates and partners, practicing as prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers, in-house counsel, counsel for start-ups, and law school graduates who have left the law.

Lawyers mediate in commercial transactions, and as part of everything they do with other lawyers, clients, staff, the government, and their families. Do you want to be in the majority of lawyers who are constantly mediating, but never take a single mediation course?  This course is a quick immersion in mediation advocacy, and mediation. It is intended for those who want to avoid being entirely unprepared for an essential part of legal practice. It is also intended for those who want to take a first step to see if mediation interests them.  The two days of class will be an interactive exploration of the strategies, tactics and theories of mediation, and mediation advocacy. Class will include: 1) a concise overview of mediation approaches and theories, 2) skills exercises, 3) multiple mediation role plays, and 4) individualized video review. Together these will allow students to think about, practice, and experiment with, the most effective approaches to mediation advocacy and mediation.  The course will be taught by Michael E. Dickstein, a full-time mediator of complex cases across the U.S. and Canada for over twenty years, and a former partner in a leading law firm, who practiced litigation, transactional, employment, and environmental law.

Using a biotechnology case as context, the curriculum is designed to translate contract principles and doctrine (to which students have been exposed,) into real-world practice. Students will acquire the foundational tools necessary to write clear, effective, plain-language provisions into agreements that memorialize a bargain between parties based on realistic situations. Exercises include simulations in which students will draft, edit, and negotiate sections of agreements.  Students will also be expected to show an understanding of what it means to develop, foster, and sustain client trust, advocate in a client's best interests, as well as effectively and ethically engage with a counter-party's counsel. Students will function as senior associates in a law firm, or as in-house counsel tasked with managing licensing and commercial transactions for a technology developer. A focus will be placed on understanding client's needs versus wants, as well as modes of supporting clients to achieve their goals while identifying, counseling, and mitigating legal risk. Exercises are designed to help students improve their critical thinking, due diligence, analysis, drafting, and editing skills, which deepens an understanding as to the expectations of attorneys and clients with whom they will be working and supporting respectively. Grades will be based heavily on class participation, skills built in simulated negotiations, as well as drafting exercises weighted by level of complexity.

Program in Corporate Governance &amp; Practice. The course, designed to be taken in conjunction with Corporations in Autumn, takes an economic approach to the analysis of corporate law. In particular, we ask why American corporate law has its particular structure. We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties and shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of a variety of real-life incidents. No knowledge of economics is presupposed, so the course will also introduce basic economics and finance concepts necessary to understand these concepts. Some course sessions, largely in the Winter and Spring will feature outside speakers who will complement the discussions with real-world examples drawn from practice. Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. Students will be required to submit short reflection papers that evaluate, critique, and discuss some or all of the key topics reviewed in the previous week's session. Students will also be asked to prepare presentations and case studies. The class will be graded H\/P\/R\/F in Autumn Quarter, Winter Quarter, and Spring Quarter. This course is required for and limited to students in the Corporate Governance and Practice LL.M. Program. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and assignments.

The course is a complement to the other core degree requirements of the LLM in IELBP and is discussion-oriented. The course offers students the opportunity to engage in dialogue with experts in the field (including Stanford Law faculty and interdisciplinary scholars from other schools, departments or programs at Stanford University).  The course takes on a wide-ranging approach: we will examine legal issues confronting international business while also focusing on cutting-edge debates arising out of economic globalization; we will explore the complex architecture of international economic law, unpacking how international institutions and public international law sources (formal and informal) regulate: i) cross-border business transactions between private parties, ii) international economic relations between and among states, and iii) cross-border economic conduct by states, international organizations, and private actors.  Students are expected to have carefully read assigned materials in advance of each session, and to actively participate during class. Grades for the colloquium are based on students' papers and their classroom performance (e.g., preparation, participation, attendance, etc.). The course extends over two quarters (autumn and spring), and students are required to complete both quarters in order to satisfy the program requirement.  Topics in the Fall quarter will focus on developments in world trade law, international monetary cooperation, international investment law, economic integration and development, international taxation, international arbitration, and international antitrust law. Topics in the Winter and Spring quarter will be selected based on students' interests, as well as pressing policy concerns in international commerce, such as climate change and national security.

For organizational purposes, the course is divided into units reflecting different areas of law and technology. Each begins with a keystone lecture that introduces students to the unit's doctrinal and theoretical themes. After the keystone lecture, each unit includes one or more topical lectures taught by experts representing a diverse cross-section of viewpoints from academia, legal practice, and business. Students are expected to have carefully read the assigned materials in advance of each session, and to actively participate during class. Students will also write papers dealing with the units' themes. Grades for the colloquium are based on students' papers and their classroom performance (e.g., preparation, participation, attendance, etc.).

The workshop will consist of specialized sessions, most of them tailored towards the work of empirical research that occurs after the data collection phase. During the quarter the fellows are expected to submit drafts of different chapters of their thesis and present their preliminary findings in class. If appropriate, the workshop may also include group and\/or individual sessions designed to address the very specific needs of the research undertaken by the SPILS Fellows.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them. As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals. At the start of each session (starting with the second session) there will be a brief quiz on the material that was covered in the readings and discussion of the prior session. During the period of the course, students will also be responsible for submitting one reflection paper (three-to-five pages) based on a prompt that will be circulated after each of the first six sessions (one paper for the entire course). These papers will be due by 11:59 on the last day the class meets. Grades will be based on the quizzes and the paper submitted, with the instructor retaining the right to take class participation into account. Attendance is mandatory and students must seek instructor approval for any absences not due to illness. This course is offered to international graduate students only. It is taught on an accelerated basis over the course of three weeks between orientation and the beginning of the Fall Quarter classes. Thus, the course meets on average nine hours per week. The exact meeting times will be set once the graduate students' schedules are set. Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, quizzes and written memo.

What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in human rights advocacy? In the space of seven decades, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discussion, if not practice. In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.  This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.). The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights; 4) to understand how recent  history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice.  During the course of the quarter you will be required to submit several short reflection papers and develop a human rights advocacy campaign.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAWGEN","tags":[{"name":"Career","organization":"VPGE"},{"name":"Personal","organization":"VPGE"},{"name":"activism","organization":"PATHWAYS"},{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"practice","organization":"HUMRTS"},{"name":"Diversity","organization":"VPGE"}],"title":"Human Rights Advocacy","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2020-2021"},"619":{"academic_career":"GR","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"206","course_id":209221,"description":"(Same as GSBGEN 382.)

This class looks to clarify and expand the participant's knowledge of the responsibilities, decisions and constraints that face law enforcement officers today, while also providing some perspectives on the national conversation about the role of law enforcement in society. Students can elect to earn two units of credit by completing the readings, short assignments, and attending 4 discussion section meetings, or students may opt to take the course for no credits and only attend the activities. The class is learning opportunity for all involved, an opportunity to build trust and develop partnerships between the Department of Public Safety and the Stanford community. While this course is open to all students throughout the University, the units will not accrue to Law Degree Candidates for credit toward a degree in Law (JD, JSM, JSD, or LLM).
