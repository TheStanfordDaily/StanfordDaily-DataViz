In this course, we will take up the first task of becoming better reasoners about a select handful of persistent problems; we will at the same time reflect on what it is that philosophical thinking is, and how it might shape us as thinkers.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-ER","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"see attached"},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"discern the ethical issues at stake in individual and collective decisions."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"evaluate competing ethical perspectives on human problems and action."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"identify, understand, and use multiple normative concepts and arguments."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"articulate and critically evaluate distinct ethical perspectives on concrete dilemmas."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: Thinking Like a Philosopher","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2015-2016"},"10":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"AII"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Ethical Reasoning (ER)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"ER"}],"code":"6","course_id":214540,"description":"Stanford's unofficial motto, &quot;the wind of freedom blows,&quot; engraved in German on the university seal, invites us the ponder freedom in the context of education.

Chinese civilization was centrally concerned with issues of the self, but it developed methods and ideals of cultivation that have no obvious parallel in the European tradition. We will be concerned primarily with two clusters of Chinese thought and expression. First, we will look at major philosophical traditions (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism) to see how they structured thinking about education and self-cultivation. The three &iquest;schools&iquest; of thought staked out different ideals for the self that provided China with range and flexibility in concepts of personhood.

First, we will look at major philosophical traditions (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism) to see how they structured thinking about education and self-cultivation. The three &iquest;schools&iquest; of thought staked out different ideals for the self that provided China with range and flexibility in concepts of personhood.

Anton Kaes (Berkeley: U of California P, 1994), an excellent collection of contemporaneous texts that is still in print and available as a reasonably priced paperback.  Topics for particular study could include &quot;expressionism,&quot; &quot;phenomenology,&quot; &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit,&quot; the Bauhaus, &quot;epic theater,&quot; proletarian art, and early German cinema, more or less following the organization of the Sourcebook.  The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.  Students will be encouraged to base their written projects on these events and on research at local archives, such as the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bauhaus-Museum.  Trips to institutions in other cities (Dessau, Weimar, etc.) could also be considered.  Primarily in English, but some topics might require German. n nThe Symphony  Material covered in this independent study could be adjusted to the student's interest and knowledge,  depending on his\/her level of musical literacy.  He\/she could focus on cultural history or on more technical, analytical  issues.  The aim will be to trace the history of the genre from its roots in the early 18th century to the present day using  mainly works from the established repertory as examples.  Visits to live performances in Berlin may also be included. n nBeethoven in German Culture  Following last year's elections in Germany, the draft coalition contract included the  following statement: &quot;The 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in 2020 offers excellent opportunities for profiling  German culture at home and abroad. Preparing for this important anniversary is thus of national concern.&quot; How and why  did Beethoven become so crucially important in German culture? In trying to answer this question, the course will begin  with a survey of Beethoven's life and works, and then focus on his legacy via key moments in reception history.

It will compare and contrast peace processes  that successfully brought wars to an end with those that failed to bring peace, and in some  cases brought dramatic escalation.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":14304,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":7,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Aug 11, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Stedman","middle_name":"J.","name":"Stedman, S.","sunet_id":"sstedman"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jun 20, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Summer","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPCPTWN","tags":[{"name":"aaas","organization":"OSP"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Major Issues in Conflict Resolution in Africa","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"195":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGCAPE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Engaging Diversity and Power (EDP)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"EDP"}],"code":"60","course_id":216986,"description":"Politics of multilingualism, diversity and hip-hop identity performances and practices in a transforming South Africa.

Drugs are used by athletes for a number of reasons, including the need to treat diseases just as non-athletes do, but very often these drugs are abused in forms that are dangerous for an athlete's health and contrary to the ethical principles of sports. Since the use of drugs in sports varies greatly from country to county, we will also look closely at the European and Italian approaches to this problem, and compare them with the American point of view.  nnParticular attention will be devoted to the concept of doping, the rules and regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and its impact on athletes' careers, both at an amateur and at a professional level. The ethical implications of doping in sports will be thoroughly and carefully considered, as described in the World Anti-Doping Code, the core document that lays out anti-doping policies, rules and regulations within sport organizations and among public authorities around the world. The differences between anti-doping regulations in the United States and Italy will be highlighted, taking examples from the history of sports and also from the latest news and reports that appear in sports media.nnThe course will also provide information on the dietary requirements of both professional athletes and those who train and exercise. The correct intake of nutrients, as well as the use of dietary supplements, will be covered, underscoring the impact that European and Italian nutrition principles and eating habits have on an athlete's performance.nnThe course will also trace the basic aspects of human biology and physiology that are needed to comprehend fully the topics at hand. In this way, students, by the end of the course, will acquire a broad and in-depth knowledge of the many principles of drug use and abuse in sports as well as under other circumstances. They will also gain a good understanding of the social and ethical implications of doping and drug addiction.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":45128,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 11, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Domenico","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Pellegrini-Giampietro","middle_name":"","name":"Pellegrini-Giampietro, D.","sunet_id":"domepell"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 4, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"hpf","organization":"HUMBIO"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"The Use and Abuse of Drugs and Nutrients in Sports","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"215":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"11","course_id":215643,"description":"Food in Italian cinema staged as an allegory of Italy's social, political and cultural milieu.

The course will be organized around several key social practices and institutions that shape selves and cultures. After first examining hypotheses about different models of the self, students will walk out into the city of Florence to investigate different domains of life through analyses of cultural products and visits to schools, churches, sporting events, museums, government offices, grocery stores, street markets, retail shops, restaurants and cafes. Each week will focus on a different topic, among which will be Family, Food, Religion, School, Sports, Dating, Literature and Culture, and Art and Architecture.

The main objective is to help students develop a critical comprehension of the inner functioning of the European Union's economics, politics and institutions, so as to understand the reasons for the crisis and the solutions undertaken.nnThis course is divided into three main parts.nnThe first part will explore the ways in which the crisis has affected the functioning of the European institutions, in particular how it has changed the role of the European Parliament, of the European Commission and of the European Council. By analyzing the European financial crisis we will be able to understand the specific institutional framework of the European Union and how it differs from the U.S.nnThe second part of this course will examine the ways in which Europe has addressed the crisis through its policies (fiscal, monetary and banking policies), and how they have consequently evolved. A comparative analysis with the United States will show the complexity entailed in having one monetary policy and nineteen distinct national budgets. nnThe third part of the class will come to grips with the bail-out programs implemented in five European countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus). We will consider both successful examples such as Spain and Ireland, and more problematic ones, such as Greece and Portugal. The rise of populist parties, in Greece and in many European countries, is addressed as one of the key challenges in Europe.nnThe course concludes by looking at the next steps in the progress of European integration: how far away (and how difficult) is the creation of a true Political Union in Europe, similar to the United states? Are the 28 Member States ready to give up more sovereignty? And if so, in which areas? If further steps are not accomplished, what are the risks of moving backwards? What are the risks of a potential disruption of the Euro? Should the U.S. be more engaged with the current European situation in light of the broader geopolitical risks?","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the origins of social institutions and social structures."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"Students should be able to: \n\na?? develop a critical comprehension of the inner functioning of the European Uniona??s economics and politics and how they influence and impact social interactions and human behavior\n\na?? understand different European institutions and their changes and challenges over time, as well as their future prospects\n \na?? comprehend the role of European democracy and its articulate interactions with national political environments\n\na?? collect and scrutinize economic data in order to identify correlations between economic time-series \n\na?? assess different hypotheses explaining key economic, political, and social developments including the recent rise of populism in Europe\n\n\n\n"},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"understand and evaluate historical and social change."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use strategies for basing conclusions about society in data including causal reasoning, historical contextualization, hypothesis testing, modeling, and critical analysis of behavior and institutions."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"critically evaluate primary and secondary source materials, and use both to explain social and historical phenomena."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":17769,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":3,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 4, 2015","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Veronica","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"De Romanis","middle_name":"","name":"De Romanis, V.","sunet_id":"vderoman"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 21, 2015","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Autumn","units":"5"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"core_appliedecon","organization":"IR"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"The Politics of the European Crisis: from the Maastricht Treaty to the Greek Crunch","units_max":5,"units_min":5,"year":"2015-2016"},"225":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"27","course_id":216955,"description":"This course will examine the cultural geography of Florence's social spaces as sites for the development of the personal, social, and political experiences of an Italian cultural identity. Focusing on literary forms, landscape art, and garden history primarily in Florence and its environs, we will consider the roles of landscape and garden design and the ways that these arts represent the cultural and social ideology of their times. Florence is the home to a range of magnificent gardens, including the Giardino Bardini, Giardino di Boboli, Giardino delle Rosa, and the Giardino di Villa Gamberaia. To understand fully Italy's historic gardens it is important to appreciate both the political and social aspirations of the garden makers. How is the reality of landscape design related to the imaginary structures of aesthetic sensibility? How do both real landscapes and imaginary forms interact with social structures and economic models? These are the kinds of questions that we will pose as we explore the gardens, country estates, and city gardens of Florence to understand both their formal structures and the social aesthetics of their eras. It will also introduce the work of &quot;social geography,&quot; especially as it relates to the study of landscape design, gardens, and the social use of public spaces in the Florence and Italian context.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Satisfactory\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":46068,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":22,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Paula","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Moya","middle_name":"M.

This course, which functions as an exploratory research group, considers how youth in Spain, including immigrant youth from North Africa and South Asia, are creating and consuming Hip Hop cultural texts (spoken word, music, film, video, other forms of visual and media arts). In addition to reading texts and analyzing films, our collective work as a class is to explore Hip Hop in Spain, a vibrant, richly-diverse Hip Hop scene. How are youth in Spain making use of Hip Hop to address contemporary social, political, and economic realities? How are they expressing their concerns and their multifaceted identities (across, race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, citizenship, etc.) through Hip Hop cultural production and consumption? How are local community organizations and Hip Hop activists harnessing the cultural power of Hip Hop for education and social justice? This course will include a field trip to Barcelona to visit with La Llama Rap Colectivo, a group of immigrant youth who produce Hip Hop that speaks to contemporary sociopolitical issues in their neighborhood like police brutality, racism\/sexism, religious discrimination, immigration and education.

These include the pressures of physical loss and physical damage associated with activities such as fishing, aggregate extraction, wind farms, anchoring and coastal development.nnThis project is funded by the French Ministry of Ecology, who consider habitat sensitivity information essential to the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the wider marine environment &iquest; both of which are obligatory under the European Habitats Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. France is not the first European country to undertake sensitivity assessments for marine habitats. Equivalent evaluations exist or are in the process of development in neighbouring EU countries, including the UK. The SPN-MNHN wants to insure that we effectively draw on these existing information sources as well as identify data gaps. All EU information would also need to be 'translated' in a way that fits with how habitats are defined and classified here in France.nnThis internship  would consist of working with the SPN-MNHN team in the analysis of the existing knowledge base, with a focus on Atlantic and English Channel habitats in France. This will support the population of &quot;habitat sensitivity matrices&quot; and highlight gaps in evidence that would require further literature review\/expert judgement.  This stage follows up on an earlier study undertaken by a Stanford student in summer 2014, entitled &quot;Review of recent methodologies to evaluate the physical impacts of fishing on marine benthic habitats&quot; which helped the SPN-MNHN and its scientific experts decide on an appropriate methodology for assessing habitat sensitivity in France in early 2015.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":6,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":46081,"component":"ITR","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 11, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Estelle","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Halevi","middle_name":"","name":"Halevi, E.","sunet_id":"ehalevi"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 4, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Winter","units":"6"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":47153,"component":"ITR","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Estelle","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Halevi","middle_name":"","name":"Halevi, E.","sunet_id":"ehalevi"}],"location":"","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"6"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":27441,"component":"ITR","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 4, 2015","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Estelle","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Halevi","middle_name":"","name":"Halevi, E.","sunet_id":"ehalevi"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 21, 2015","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Autumn","units":"6"}],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Oceanography Research Internship","units_max":6,"units_min":6,"year":"2015-2016"},"407":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"11","course_id":211739,"description":"Often initiated by special contacts between students and professionals in France.

The goal of the course is twofold: on the one hand, we would like students to become familiar with some of the most popular modern Latin American myths\/icons and how they cut across genres, periods, and media. On the other, beyond familiarity, students will become participants, both creatively and critically, in the recreation of such figures. We will consider a variety of sources and make extensive use of local opportunities, such as visiting museums or attending concerts","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":46018,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Hector","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hoyos","middle_name":"M.","name":"Hoyos, H.","sunet_id":"hhoyos"},{"first_name":"Ximena","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Briceno","middle_name":"M.","name":"Briceno, X.","sunet_id":"xbriceno"}],"location":"","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"3-5"}],"subject":"OSPSANTG","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Modern Latin American Myths and Icons","units_max":5,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"481":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGSANT","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"58","course_id":203299,"description":"Physical, ecological, and human geography of Chile.

How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, &quot;dorm lab&quot; component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students &quot;a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. &quot; (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science

We start with the emergence of genocide as a modern, international issue; proceed with colonial massacres in early 20th century Africa; move to the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire and WWI; Nazi and Nazi-inspired racial murder; communist-induced mass violence in the Soviet Union and Asia; ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia; and end with an examination of the recent genocides in Rwanda, Sudan, and the Middle East.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"The course aims at developing a critical approach to a major and recurring phenomenon in human historya??mass violencea??and analyzes what motivates leaders, societies, and individuals to apply acts of mass killing, why they believe it is doable and legitimate, what the reactions of the victims are, and how these acts can be prevented or stopped."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":45622,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday","Friday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"David","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Blome","middle_name":"","name":"Blome, D.","sunet_id":"dablome"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":45621,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"3:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Lauren","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hirshberg","middle_name":"","name":"Hirshberg, L.","sunet_id":"lhirshbe"}],"location":"240-110","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":45620,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Lauren","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hirshberg","middle_name":"","name":"Hirshberg, L.","sunet_id":"lhirshbe"},{"first_name":"Parna","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sengupta","middle_name":"","name":"Sengupta, P.","sunet_id":"parnas"}],"location":"240-110","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":45602,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":34,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":90,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Amir","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Weiner","middle_name":"","name":"Weiner, A.","sunet_id":"weiner"}],"location":"200-034","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":45623,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday","Friday"],"end_date":"Jun 1, 2016","end_time":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"David","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Blome","middle_name":"","name":"Blome, D.","sunet_id":"dablome"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"05","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":""}],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"cc-ff-spring","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Century of Violence","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"550":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"13","course_id":213225,"description":"What makes an epic hero?  How does the epic poem externalize our quest for identity and self-definition?nnnnThe human quest for identity and self-knowledge is the oldest story of human culture.  It almost always involves a confrontation with death. As the epic hero journeys across the physical world and descends into the underworld to visit the dead and seek counsel from them, he gradually comes to understand himself in a deeper, more meaningful way than before he set out on his journey.  In this course, you will learn to engage in depth with some of the great epics of the Western tradition, beginning with The Epic of Gilgamesh and ending with Dante's masterpiece, The Divine Comedy. In each case, we will consider the unique goals of each hero's journey and the obstacles he must confront in order to reach his destination, with particular attention to the themes of violence in self and society, exile and alienation, the encounter with ancestors, the female voice, and divine guidance. We will focus on how the hero's search for a moral identity in relation to his community connects to current definitions of the ethical life in relation to political violence, war, honoring the dead, and confronting our mortality.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Epic Journeys","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"551":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Scientific Method and Analysis (SMA)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SMA"}],"code":"15","course_id":213227,"description":"How do the biology and chemistry of the brain create the mind that lets us talk, walk, laugh, love, learn, remember, and forget?

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

This class asks what folklore means and what purposes - political and philosophical as well as artistic - it can serve.  We begin with examples from around the world: the German Brothers Grimm as well as the Americans John and Alan Lomax.  Then we turn to Eastern Europe and the role it has played in the Western European and American imagination as the home of the archaic and the authentic, from the vampires of Transylvania to the oral epics of the Bosnian Serbs to the nostalgic idea of the Jewish shtetl to the fantasy of Soviet communism as a survival of a pre-capitalist order.

Energy use is intricately woven through the fabric of the productive (and comfortable) lives we live in the developed world.  We use energy to move and sometimes make fresh water, grow food, transport it to markets, heat, cool, and light our dwellings and workplaces, communicate and compute, and travel the world.  We worry about energy security and fret about the cost of gasoline.  And as world population continues to grow and the developing world seeks to use energy for the services we enjoy, the challenge of supplying the energy the world needs will grow commensurately.

Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals.

In this course we will examine the classical roots, medieval developments, and contemporary permutations of Western ideas of romantic love. With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender. We discuss these works of the past, for example the illicit love in the courtly romance Tristan, in tandem with representations of clandestine love from the present day, such as the portrayal of same-sex love in Brokeback Mountain.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter

do people believe in God? What does it mean for people to experience the supernatural? How do we understand belief in God? How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others? In this course we ask the big (and unanswerable) question why people believe in God. Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Democracy and republic are ancient names for revolutionary approaches to government of, by, and for citizens. Today, almost every state proclaims itself to be a democracy, a republic -- or both. Democratic and republican revolutions transformed ancient Greece and Rome - and later transformed the modern world. We explore how political thinkers, from Machiavelli to Madison and Mill, used the lessons of ancient politics to design bold new systems of government. Ancient politics may still hold lessons for us. We analyze what is broken in modern government (corruption, polarization, gridlock), how it broke, and how the tool kit of ancient political history might help us to analyze and repair the

Culture informs and distorts how we discern, accept, reject, and analyze our bodies. Looking at literary, medical, ethical, and anthropological texts, we ask how representations of the body affects the way we experience illness, embody gender and racial identities, and understand our rights (or lack of rights) to control our own bodies.

we perceive the world through stories? Are we made of stories? Can we make sense of the world without narrative? The telling of stories is not just a form of entertainment but an essential human activity that moves and persuades us, compelling us to action and reflection. In this course, we will probe how moral, cognitive and historical forces give stories their power. You will be introduced to the basic theory and art of storytelling, enabling you to understand and master the fundamentals of narrative structure, plot, and character. This will allow you to practice producing your own stories through both interpretative and creative writing assignments. The class will also give students the chance to participate in various story-making activities and work with the Stanford Storytelling Project, San Francisco StoryCorps, School of the Arts and the Stanford Innocence Project to create assignments that would be useful to both private and nonprofit organizations.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Your access to Stanford has granted you a certain expert label, even if it doesn't always feel that way. This course leverages your growing expertise by introducing you to writing styles and genres that will allow you to communicate your technical interests to a non-expert, or popular, audience. We'll talk about stylistic points including story ledes and anecdotes, metaphor, and organizing familiar and non-familiar language in our writing. We'll also experiment with different genres that accomplish these translation goals by experimenting with writing abstracts, journalism pieces, provocative podcasts, first-person narratives, visual essays, and creative non-fiction essays. Our ultimate goal will be to not only better understand these styles and genres in order to communicate more effectively with a wide variety of audiences, but to also seek publication in local newspapers, blogs, and sources such as <i>Salon, Slate, The Huffington Post, The Atlantic,<\/i> and even <i>Wired<\/i> or <i>Radiolab<\/i>.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Intermediate Writing: Science and Technology Writing for Popular Audiences","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"884":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"91CL","course_id":215937,"description":"Despite the widespread assumption that scientists are weak communicators, many of today&iquest;s most celebrated essayists hail from backgrounds in the hard sciences.

Similarly, neurologist and writer, Oliver Sacks&iquest; compassionate ruminations on mental disability advance fresh thinking on the nature of difference. Inversely, many essayists hailing from &iquest;fuzzy&iquest; backgrounds, deploy techniques usually associated with scientific observation to electrify their prose: To wit, the works of brilliant stylists like Annie Dillard, Chang-rae Lee, and Mark Doty are characterized by the kind of deep observation that underpins scientific inquiry.

Each student will begin the quarter by posing a question of personal or professional significance about how some aspect of the natural, social, technological or cultural world works. Using these questions as a starting point, students will then design a research process to first complicate, and then perhaps also answer, their initial question. The end product of the inquiry will be a self-fashioned experimental essay that can engage a discerning public audience.

What universal themes do we detect, and what separates the progression of a pacific north west Trickster story from an Arthurian romance? Why is it that in the early twenty first century many of our most acclaimed art forms carry narrative forms that are thousands of years old? Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and the recent broadway show Jerusalem, all follow scenic progressions informed by myth.nnnThe first encounter with the story will be an oral narrative - the myth told unscripted in the classroom. The stories, which range from the Arthurian romance Parzival to Trickster folk tales, will be told in several sections - with a running exegesis and student response alongside. Many of these stories are now transcripts and have become works of literature. We will explore both the complementary aspects of this development, and areas of tension.nnnDuring the course each student will embark on a project that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topics covered, and utilizes those elements in their wider practice of writing and rhetoric. nnnThe project will be to research a story handed down within the family - an adventure of some distant relative, or a family migration from one country to another. Factoring in elements from the taught class, the student will mythologize the story: by writing an in depth commentary on its implications - factoring in contemporary, psychological and metaphorical associations.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story.

What debates are taking place inside Black communities about activism? About community itself? What is it about twitter, vines and memes that have made those spaces such rich spaces for Black expressive cultures? What stylistic or aesthetic features mark those communicative efforts? Finally, what do young people themselves have to say about activism in this moment?

In this course, we will interrogate empathy as an ethical model and a rhetorical strategy for effecting social change. Partisanship is at an all time high in the US, being as ingrained and divisive now as race. And a 2015 poll showed that almost six in ten Americans--heavy majorities of both blacks and whites--believe that &quot;race relations are generally bad, and nearly four in 10 think the situation is getting worse.&quot; Stanford's campus has been no stranger to these controversies--divestment from Palestine and fossil fuels, Slow Down for Michael Brown, sexual assault punishments, and accusations of anti-Jewish bias in election endorsements. So, do we need an &quot;empathy revolution,&quot; or should we be &quot;against empathy&quot; or is it more complicated? To get at these questions, we will read about empathy from the perspective of morality, neuroscience, social movements and rhetoric; and practice compassion meditation. Finally, with the course readings and discussions in mind, you will write about a social change issue you believe might, or might not, benefit from an empathetic framework.
