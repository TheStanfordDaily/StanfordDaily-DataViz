in which competitive forces are weak. The focus is on monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and other environments where market mechanisms are unlikely to produce outcomes that benefit consumers more than the alternatives involving costly government intervention. The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provides consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and\/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as:  telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases.  The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The primary focus is on understanding the mapping between underlying economic events and financial statements, and how this mapping can affect inferences about future firm profitability. To this end, the course will provide an introduction to: (1) accrual accounting concepts, principles and conventions; (2) the process of preparing and presenting the primary financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows); (3) the judgment involved and discretion allowed in making accounting choices; (4) the effects of accounting discretion on the quality of the (reported) financial information; and (5) the fundamentals of financial statement analysis.

The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art-and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded? We anticipate having two or three visitors to the class during the quarter, such as a gallery owner, auctioneer, and museum director. In addition, we will also have the students participate in at least one or two interactive negotiation simulation exercises inspired by real situations and controversies in the art world.

The course assumes basic familiarity with the way courts resolve lawsuits between two parties.  It also assumes that students are familiar with the basics of territorial and subject matter jurisdiction--which we will build on over the course of the semester.  The course starts with the law of preclusion, filling in any gaps in coverage from first year.  After a brief review of the law of joint and several liability, the course will cover simple joinder of claims (Rule 18), joinder of plaintiffs and defendants (Rule 20), cross-claims and third party practice (Rule 13 and 14).  Then we'll look at problems of non-parties--those who want to intervene in the litigation (Rule 24) and those who decline to intervene and cannot be joined (Rule 19).  Throughout, we will pay attention to the relationship between federal joinder rules and federal subject matter jurisdiction, including the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute.  We'll very briefly glance at the law of interpleader, both under Rule 22 and the federal interpleader statute.  The second part of the course will deal with class actions under Federal Rule 23.  It will cover the types of class action (limited fund, injunction, damages), the differing requirements for certification of the various types of actions, and how trial and appellate courts approach critical issues of certification, notice and jurisdiction, collective proof, settlement and preclusion.  Cases will give a feel of the issues across various types of class action: including consumer, antitrust, securities, civil rights and employment litigation.  The course will also look at the federalization of state class action law, including important recent case law from the US Supreme Court upholding class action waivers in contracts of adhesion containing arbitration clauses and legislation expanding federal subject matter jurisdiction over diversity class actions.  In view of the likely decline of class action practice in certain fields of law, we'll also look at contractual and statutory substitutes for class action approaches.  The final topic in the class will be multidistrict litigation, including the statutory authority for multi-district transfers, how they differ from transfers for trial, the standards that govern where and how a multidistrict proceeding is established, and some current issues of law, practice and policy, focusing on mass tort and product liability cases.  At the end of the course, you should know and be able to apply the rules covered, have some sense of how those rules figure in developing plaintiff and defense strategies in complex cases, understand the kinds of arguments that are likely to move trial and appellate judges presiding in such cases, and begin to see the hard policy choices involved in the design of rules for resolving such cases.

The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, and seminar discussions -- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process. Essentially, in a given context, what is the relationship of law to political, social, and economic change?  This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary.  Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper (for R credit) or an in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred.

A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic. - - Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, preparation for and participation in clinic seminar; reflection papers; and clinical case and project work including specific elements of methodical analysis, critical thinking, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and strategy development, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":16195,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":8,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"May 27, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jef","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Pearlman","middle_name":"","name":"Pearlman, J.","sunet_id":"jefpearl"},{"first_name":"Phillip","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Malone","middle_name":"Robert","name":"Malone, P.","sunet_id":"pmalone"}],"location":"","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":15825,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":8,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 7, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jef","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Pearlman","middle_name":"","name":"Pearlman, J.","sunet_id":"jefpearl"},{"first_name":"Phillip","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Malone","middle_name":"Robert","name":"Malone, P.","sunet_id":"pmalone"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 4, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Juelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic: Clinical Coursework","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"49":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"267","course_id":211310,"description":"This course provides an overview of the rules governing the formation and operation of nonprofit organizations.

In the clinic, students develop legal advice, learn to review and write contracts and governance materials, meet with client executives, examine commercial relationships, and receive extensive feedback about their work. No prior experience in business, finance, or corporate law is necessary.  Students work on structural, programmatic, contractual, affiliation, and governance matters for corporate entities. Students typically represent multiple clients during the term, interact with client CEOs, CFOs, board members, and general counsels, and work in teams with other students and the instructors. Students receive detailed comments about the design, content, and execution of work-products and client communications, and about their performance in client meetings and calls. Students regularly assess their own work throughout the quarter and prepare a self-evaluation at the end of the term.  O&amp;T clients are all established Northern California nonprofit corporations. Most of the clients generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $25 million, and some are considerably larger. We focus on these organizations because they are corporations that typically have substantial governance and external disclosure obligations, active boards of directors, audited financial statements, complex programs, varied collaborations, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the clinic's contact is a senior executive. We think they provide excellent material for students learning about organizational representation and institutional corporate practice.  The course includes a seminar that generally meets twice a week. Seminar meetings focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management.  Evaluation and grading are based on detailed points of emphasis that reflect ways of working we believe characterize an effective lawyer and responsible colleague. Course design and operation reflect the instructors' combined 40+ years of corporate practice representing consumer products, finance, technology, and life science companies, in both law firm and senior in-house roles.

Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: The syllabus includes specific expectations and criteria relating to methodical analysis, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and crisp execution, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":17774,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Nov 20, 2015","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jay","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"A","name":"Mitchell, J.","sunet_id":"jam75"},{"first_name":"Michelle","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Sonu","middle_name":"","name":"Sonu, M.","sunet_id":"msonu"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 21, 2015","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Autumn","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":16387,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"May 27, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jay","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"A","name":"Mitchell, J.","sunet_id":"jam75"},{"first_name":"Michelle","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Sonu","middle_name":"","name":"Sonu, M.","sunet_id":"msonu"}],"location":"","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"4"}],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Organizations and Transactions Clinic: Clinical Coursework","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"55":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"273","course_id":209586,"description":"This course applies economic concepts to the practice of structuring contracts.

A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and\/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured &quot;public law&quot; litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity. In addition to examining these distinctive problem areas, we will look at broader, cross-cutting institutional reform proposals that have received recent attention.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism. This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship. This course complements Constitutional Litigation (Law 641), and students, especially those who plan to clerk, will benefit from taking both courses. In-School: Three hour exam.

A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal court litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements, in response to which the federal courts have developed. Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create &quot;legislative courts&quot; outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the &quot;final cut&quot; and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations.  The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

Students will also consider the shifting regulatory landscape for financial institutions and hedge funds as it relates to the way in which these products are traded, with rates and credit products migrating to clearinghouses. The course will conclude with an examination of the economic crisis that erupted with Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008 and the consequent policy reactions to that event from a derivatives and bankruptcy perspective.

This course explores the evolution of the role of the general counsel in major American public companies and, more broadly, the expanding role of in-house counsel. These are the lawyers in the trenches, on the front lines of American businesses. Each week, we'll review another dimension of the general counsel's job. We'll consider how general counsel today play an important role on the executive team of major companies and explore the different ways in which general counsels manage large corporate legal departments and direct functional legal areas like litigation, IP, corporate and securities, M&amp;A, environmental and employment law. We will also examine the professional responsibilities and legal obligations of the general counsel -- including the delicate and sometimes conflicting reporting relationships to the CEO and the board of directors -- and consider how an in-house legal department fits into a corporation's organizational structure and how it supports the company's operating units on a day-to-day basis. We will explore the general counsel's role in internal investigations, regulatory investigations and compliance programs, and governmental affairs.  We will also consider current practices in how in-house lawyers select, collaborate with and evaluate outside counsel. The class will meet weekly and we will invite current and former general counsels to join us occasionally for our discussions.

Since the establishment by the Security Council of the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia twenty years ago, the field has experienced remarkable growth. The international community has created a range of new international criminal tribunals to investigate and prosecute international crimes. National courts are now also exercising an expanded domestic and universal criminal jurisdiction over international or transnational crimes. The substantive criminal law has also expanded, and notions of individual responsibility for international crimes have evolved and extend the reach of international criminal law.  At the same time, new debates have emerged about the suitability of using criminal justice mechanisms to respond to mass atrocity situations. nnThis course will explore legal and institutional responses to transnational and international crime.  It will examine traditional forms of international cooperation to address transnational crimes and the concept of universal jurisdiction that provides a basis for treating certain crimes as &quot;international.&quot;  It will cover the range of institutions created to punish international criminals, including the Nuremburg and Tokyo tribunals, the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the &quot;mixed&quot; international\/domestic tribunals such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Cambodia war crimes tribunal, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. As these tribunals approach the end of their mandates, the International Criminal Court is assuming greater importance. The progress of the ICC will be considered and, so too, the role of the United States in all of these developments. Alternative institutional arrangements and options for responding to international crimes, such as truth commissions and amnesties will also be examined. nnThe course will also include: (1) the moral and political goals that motivate responses to international crimes; (2) the role of international politics and foreign policy considerations in shaping responses to international crimes; (3) the suitability of different institutional models for addressing international crimes. nnThe grade for this course will be based on a final research paper of 26 pages, double spaced.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them. As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals.

Employment-related lawsuits filed in federal court have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases.

This course examines this diverse, rewarding, and rapidly evolving area of legal practice by considering the diverse array of laws and institutions that regulate the employment relationship.  The substantive focus of the course is on laws that affect employees in non-unionized settings, such as protections against dismissal without cause, wage and hour restrictions, workplace privacy, covenants not to compete, and mandatory arbitration of employment disputes. The course does not cover either Employment Discrimination or Labor Law, both of which are offered as separate courses. The pedagogic approach is to ask students to work through problems, on your own and in small groups in class, where you have to generate and evaluate options to counsel clients on workplace-law issues.

This seminar will explore the role of scientific experts in patent infringement litigation.  The class will have a mix of law students and doctoral candidates from the sciences and engineering.  The law students must have some familiarity with United States patent law from classes or work experience.  The graduate students must have completed their required coursework and have TGR status. In other areas of the law where scientific experts are used -- medical malpractice, environmental law, criminal law -- the science itself is often in dispute.  In patent cases, however, the parties generally agree on the science. This affects the relationship between the lawyer and the expert and the substantive content of their interactions. Patent experts need to be able to explain science to the judge and jury, of course.  But they also must help the litigators to choose which legal issues to press and which to concede, and to be aware of how the complications of the science might help, hurt, obscure or reveal how the law should be applied to the facts.  Thus, both the lawyer and the scientist must educate the other about their specialties.nnFor the first several weeks, the class will examine judicial decisions and trial documents involving scientific evidence in patent litigation.  The rest of the quarter is largely devoted to work on the final projects: simulations of expert testimony in a patent case.  Students will work together in teams an will meet regularly with the instructor in order to: select suitable patents; identify a balanced issue on either validity or infringement; prepare claim charts and materials for testimony; and give short, illustrated talks to inform their classmates about their projects.  Finally, they will choose sides (patent owner or accused infringer) and finetune their presentations.

Given the constraints of the quarter system, the product is more likely to end with a detailed project design rather than a fully implemented study. nnSuccessful completion of the course requires regular attendance, and: (I) Careful reading of the course assignments coupled with frequent one page written assignments on the reading; (2) A PowerPoint presentation to the class discussing a major paper; and  (3) A detailed project design using one of the empirical approaches discussed in the class. nnElements used in grading:  Attendance, written assignments, class-room presentation and paper.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Advanced Empirical Methods","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"145":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"361","course_id":126823,"description":"(Same as SOC 133\/333.)

The first will trace the substantive and procedural evolution of the common law from its early English roots and writs to its role in the American legal system today.  Another thread will emphasize conceptions of the common law, including both historical accounts derived from the writings of Sir Edward Coke, Matthew Hale, Jeremy Bentham, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, and more recent theoretical contributions by Guido Calabresi and Ronald Dworkin, among others.  Finally, the course will examine certain central institutions of the common law, including the judge who follows precedent and the jury, and compare common law modes of adjudication with the alternative methods employed by the Chancellor in equity and judges in the civil law system.

Speakers will include Reva Siegel, the Nicholas deB. Katzenbach Professor of Law at Yale Law School, and Thomas Sugrue, the David Boies Professor of History and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, as well several other scholars of law, the social sciences and humanities writing about this topic. In the week prior to a given speaker's presentation, the class will meet as a group to discuss secondary literature relevant to understanding and critiquing the speaker's research. Students will then read the speaker's paper in advance of the following week's workshop presentation.  Special Instructions: Students are required to write a brief response to each speaker's paper. There will be a total of four speakers, and thus four papers. Guidance will be provided concerning how to frame these response papers, which will be due every two weeks - i.e., on the day before speaker presents and students will receive &quot;W&quot; writing credit. Students taking the course to receive &quot;R&quot; research credit are required to write a research paper on a legal history topic that they choose (in consultation with the professor).

Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted. As we study these subjects, we will also reflect on whether taking some reforms too far will impair on the efficacy of legitimate law enforcement. The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants).

Modern technological, economic and business forces are placing extreme pressure on the traditional private attorney law firm model.  These forces will transform, eliminate or replace virtually every aspect of legal services provided by attorneys.  Traditional foundations of the large law firm model such as &quot;billable&quot; hours, summer associate programs, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries) and high associate-to-partner ratios are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era.  Today, the business need for clients to select a one-stop, full-service law firm for their important legal work has, in a variety of circumstances, disappeared.  Sophisticated clients are utilizing a wide range of legal services firms and companies for their legal work.  As a result, the diversity of legal business models and manner of providing legal services has greatly expanded.  Often individual lawyers (or very small firms) can provide high-level legal services by assembling &quot;virtual&quot; teams in which each team member handles a different constituent part of the representation.  &quot;In-sourcing,&quot; &quot;out-sourcing&quot; and the transferring of large portions of work to non-lawyer legal support vendors are all becoming fixtures of the legal economy.  This rapid increase in diversity on both the supply and demand side of the legal economy will greatly alter the skills and prerequisites required for the successful private practice of law.  The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined.  In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.  Part two of the course will additionally focus on how specific skills such as project management, social networking and information management will be crucial to a successful legal career.

The seminar will also survey the rich non-legal and interdisciplinary discourses on theories of redress and repair including scholarship on reparations, restorative justice, and rectification.  In order to develop a comparative base for assessing the capacity of law to reach and repair complex group-based harms, special attention will be given to cultural practices that have emerged to supplement, substitute for, and sometimes subvert legal remedies.

By analyzing agencies, statutes, and legislative procedures, the course prepares students to think about the structures and processes of government, and how they influence legal outcomes that would otherwise be defined largely by social norms, economic transactions, and common law adjudication.  Drawing on examples from a variety of substantive areas, the course covers the legislative process, approaches to statutory interpretation, the role of agencies and the legislature in a system of separated powers, delegation to agencies, the interaction of common law doctrines and agency practices, and techniques of agency regulation and adjudication. First-year students are welcome.  Special Instructions:  Students who receive credit for Legislation (Law 319) and\/or Statutory Interpretation (Law 425) may not receive credit for Legislation and Administration (Law 394) and vice versa.

The readings on deterrence and racial discrimination will entail some substantial statistical analysis, although a background in statistics, though helpful, will not be required.

Students who take the practicum component must attend the 9 seminar class meetings and  do all reading and writing assignments of the seminar except that instead of writing a final paper of their choosing they will focus on actual policy or litigation work that will be arranged with various death penalty abolition groups.

class will focus on the legal and non-legal tactical details of entrepreneurial endeavors. The legal specifics of corporate formation, tax, and contracts are well covered by a variety of other courses at the Law School and will only be reviewed briefly in this course. Instead, the course will examine the life stages (formation, financing, execution, and exit) of a venture-backed company from the entrepreneur's perspective. Students who are interested in either starting companies or working with startup founders as their legal counsel will solidify their foundations in this course. There will be no textbook - course materials will include PowerPoint slides, readings from various entrepreneur and venture capital blogs, sample business plans, and other sources.  Grades will be based on class participation (10%), short reflection papers and\/or short problem sets (15%), and a 60 minute oral business plan presentation with accompanying slide deck and written business plan.  This course is limited to 16 students with students who have taken VC I receiving priority in enrollment.  Prerequisites: A modest background in financial analysis or Excel, such as might be obtained in QM finance (Law 467), is a prerequisite for this course.  Venture Capital I will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.  Elements used in grading: Class participation (20%), and a 60 minute oral business plan presentation with accompanying slide deck and written materials (80%).  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

Autumn term will be dedicated to brief writing and completion of the written portion of the Competition; the oral argument portion of the Competition will be conducted during the first four weeks (approx.) of Winter term. Students on externship and in clinics may enroll if permitted by their respective programs.  In Autumn term there are only a few class meetings, which can be recorded, as well as conferences and practice arguments, which are scheduled individually. In Winter term, students must participate in scheduled oral arguments. The preliminary rounds are in the evening; the semifinal and final rounds are in the late afternoon. Prior to the Competition itself, materials and lectures are provided on research, brief writing, and oral advocacy techniques. Registration for the Kirkwood Competition is by team. Each team is required to submit an appellate brief of substantial length and quality, and to complete at least two oral arguments, one on each side of an actual case. The first draft of the brief is reviewed and critiqued by the course instructors. The final draft of the brief is scored by the course instructors and members of the Moot Court Board. The course also offers digital recording and critiques of practice oral arguments. Panels of local attorneys and judges serve as judges who score the oral argument portion of the Competition. Teams are selected for the quarterfinal, semifinal and final round of the Competition based on their brief and oral advocacy scores. The final round of the Competition is held before a panel of distinguished judges and the entire Law School community is invited to attend. Special Instructions: In order to maintain academic standards, enrollment in the Kirkwood Competition is limited to 20 two-person teams. This limit will be strictly enforced.

We will look at the internet, mobile platforms and drones, among other developments. The class will identify both privacy defeating and privacy enhancing technologies, and consider how legal regimes and policy choices as well as technological design can mitigate or highten the risk of unwanted information disclosure.

This is a practical course for students who are interested in applying their knowledge to deal structuring, identifying and resolving legal and business concerns, negotiations, documentation and deal closing. The caselets (short-form cases), developed by the instructor (JD\/MBA\/CPA) from his 25 years' experience in deal-making in China and Asia, raising $9 billion in equity and debt, often place the student inside the negotiating room and challenge the student to strike deals with senior private and public officials. This course is structured as an intense large seminar with a maximum of 30 law and 10 business students, mixed into groups for class work and presentations.nnCourse objectives: (1) To give the law student a deeper understanding of the legal issues that arise in cross-border transactions, and a broader understanding of the business context in which legal advice is asked for and given; (2) to give the business student an appreciation of the importance of reading the legal documents which purport to describe his\/her business transaction, and an understanding of the role the legal advisor can and should play in deal structuring, negotiating and documenting aspects; and (3) for both sets of students, there will be the opportunity to strategize, structure and be the principal negotiator in real world, substantive, international business deals. Following the outcomes decided in class, the actual outcomes and subsequent events will be shared.

Students are California Bar Certified and thus appear in court and argue their clients' cases with faculty standing by.  Students take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with prosecutors, drafting and arguing motions, and trying cases before judges and juries. Common charges include drug use and possession, assault, theft and DUI.  While students have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all work is closely supervised. The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through a two-week introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias in the legal system, immigration consequences, economic disparities and addiction.  The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case from beginning to end while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.

(Family members are appropriate for only 30% of patients needing these transplants.)  The NBMD is considering whether the procedures that it uses to attract people to enroll as potential donors in the registry could be improved, and also wants to investigate the further possibility that the proportion of potential donors who actually donate cells once it is discovered that they are a match for a particular patient could be increased. Social psychologists here at Stanford are interested in working with the NBMD to examine some of the organization&iquest;s practices, taking advantage of the sorts of social psychological insights often employed by those interested in marketing products or increasing charitable donations. There are questions, of course, about the efficacy of the techniques that they might recommend in terms of increasing ultimate donation levels, but there are also significant questions about whether some of the techniques might run afoul of existing legal regulation or pose other sorts of problems for the organization.  Law students who choose to work on this practicum will almost surely work (in teams with other law students and in conjunction with social psychologists working on this issue and the NBMD) on the following issues: -- To what extent is it consonant with existing medical privacy law (or laws that the NBMD might press to adopt) to reveal personal information about donees to potential donors, assuming that donors are more likely to donate to those with whom they feel a greater personal connection? -- To what degree can NBMD simplify the process of registering potential donors without running afoul of current (or ideal) regulation protecting people against undergoing medical procedures in the absence of informed consent? -- What sorts of material incentives for donation, if any, are permissible under current (or ideal) law and what stance should the NBMD take on the use of material incentives?

This concern has spread to Congress and the U.S. Patent Office, which are considering new regulation of patent trolls. However, there remains insufficient data to determine the amount and impact of patent troll litigation. Students selected for this course will work with renowned patent law scholar Mark Lemley and Law, Science &amp; Technology Teaching Fellow Shawn Miller to produce the first patent litigation database to include comprehensive identification of the type of patent plaintiff involved in each lawsuit. Students' principal responsibilities during 2015-16 will be to complete the database and help draft a position paper for policy makers on the impact of patent trolls. Though voluntary, Professor Lemley and Dr. Miller will also encourage and aid students in utilizing this experience and the database for their own scholarly work.

Economically disadvantaged students are underrepresented at most selective colleges or universities. This despite the fact that in recent years a number of prominent universities (Stanford among them) have made their financial aid policies considerably more generous for students from lower income families.nRecent research indicates that the pool of resource disadvantaged, high achieving high school students is much larger than commonly thought. Each year, there are more than 25,000 high school seniors from relatively low income families whose standardized test scores and grades place them in the top 4% of high school students, making it likely that they could be admitted to, receive financial aid from, and thrive at a selective institution. Yet many thousands of these talented students do not apply to any top tier college. Some do not even apply to any four year school. nThis failure in the matching of students to schools is socially significant. While higher education has long been a means of promoting mobility for individuals and across generations, the economic benefits of advanced education are even greater now than in past eras. Thus, it has become especially important that universities provide an avenue of advancement for talented students of all backgrounds.nThe Mobility Project is also timely given the likelihood of increasing restrictions on race-based affirmative action. Expanding access to elite colleges for economically disadvantaged students will also contribute to the racial diversity of those institutions. The group of low income, high achievers is more racially diverse (and more specifically, has a higher representation of African Americans and Latinos) than the group of high achieving students from affluent families.nWe will examine a variety of initiatives to increase the enrollment at elite universities of high achieving economically disadvantaged students.

Rivers in the western United States are subject to significant water withdrawals that have had major impacts on the health of their ecosystems.  In an effort to restore the health of such rivers, a number of conservation groups have begun to facilitate voluntary transactions to restore water to the environment, such as acquiring water rights and funding irrigation efficiency improvements.  NFWF has extensive experience with these efforts through its funding of the Columbia Basin Water Transaction Program and implementation of the Walker Basin Restoration Program, and intends to expand its efforts to other parts of the West.  It faces the challenge of deciding where to invest funds and resources in order to achieve the greatest conservation benefits for available dollars.  Students in this policy lab will assist NFWF in the development of an assessment methodology for identifying and analyzing watersheds in the western United States as potential locations for expanding its efforts.  Our work will focus on evaluating western states in terms of the extent to which they allow the transfer of water rights for environmental use and in terms of the regulatory, financial, and social hurdles such transactions face in each state.  We will also analyze data related to stream flow alteration and work with NFWF to integrate this information into its broader assessment.

This project will examine how changes in licensing rules governing health care providers' allowed scope of practice can accommodate the expansion of demand for health services due to the Affordable Care Act and other factors.  Specific questions include:  1)  Under existing state law, what additional tasks can non-physicians such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and pharmacists undertake that would reduce cost and\/or improve quality?  2)  What changes to state law might expand the allowed scope of practice of non-physicians that would reduce cost and\/or improve quality?  3) What incentives might the federal government provide, either through Medicare or other means, to encourage states to reform optimally their scope of practice rules to reflect new available technologies?nDesigning antitrust policy to achieve the benefits of coordination and avoid the costs of consolidation.  On one hand, closer links between physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers has the potential to reduce cost and improve quality by improving communication across care settings, avoiding wasteful duplication of effort, and reducing medical errors.  On the other hand, consolidation may be used to exploit consumers by facilitating the exercise of health care providers' market power.  This tension has become especially important due to incentives in the Affordable Care Act that encourage doctors and hospitals to join together in Accountable Care Organizations.  This project will examine the following questions:  1)  How can the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission use existing federal antitrust law to allow welfare-improving coordination while prohibiting welfare-reducing consolidation in ways that minimize costs of enforcement, including the legal uncertainty facing providers?  2)  Can adoption of health-care-specific antitrust laws, such as those proposed or enacted in Massachusetts and California, effectively fill in the gaps in existing federal antitrust laws?  3)  What incentives might the federal government provide, through design of reimbursement policies in the Medicare program, to complement federal and state antitrust laws?nConsent Application: To apply for this course, students must complete and e-mail the Consent Application Form available on the SLS Registrar's Office website (see Registration and Selection of Classes for Stanford Law Students) to the instructors.

The price of ivory on black markets has skyrocketed and elephant and rhino populations in Africa are being decimated.  At current poaching rates, African elephants could be wiped out within 8 to 10 years.  Trafficking also is hitting tigers, great apes, sharks and other important species.  The seminar will key into the President's recent Executive Order on this subject (E.O. 13658, issued on July 1, 2013) and related international efforts to reduce the killing in host countries, the transshipment of poached materials, and consumer demand for ivory and other wildlife parts.  The seminar will address US laws and their role in addressing trade in wildlife parts.  It also will undertake a comparative review of the legal structures in relevant African and Asian nations, and the potential role of the international endangered species treaty (CITES) and transnational enforcement efforts in cracking down on ivory and other wildlife-related trafficking.  The seminar will review prior poaching crises, including the elephant\/ivory crisis in the late 1980s, and evaluate why the strategies that reduced killings in the 1990s are no longer successful.  Based on these analyses, the class will develop and submit recommendations for reforms to US, African, and international laws and practices to two groups established under the Executive Order:  (1) the President's Wildlife Trafficking Task Force, which is chaired by the Secretaries of State and Interior and the Attorney General; and (2) the Wildlife Trafficking Advisory Council, which is composed of outside experts who are advising the Task Force.

The General National Congress, elected in 2012, is mandated to form a government, promulgate legislation for Libya's transitional period, and establish a constitution-drafting entity.  A de facto federal structure has emerged since the fall of the Qaddafi regime, and it appears that a federal state structure is the only way forward for Libya.  Even a decentralized framework may be threatened, however, if it does not clearly delineate the powers of the executive heads of provincial territories.  Students in this Practicum will work to support the Public Interest Law and Policy Group PILPG), a pro bono international law firm, which in turn is providing advice to civil society groups in Libya.  To assist PILPG in supporting its clients' engagement on constitutional issues and decentralization, students in this Practicum will develop a legal memorandum analyzing comparative state practice of the distribution of powers between the national executive and provincial level executives in federal or decentralized states.  The memorandum will address approaches states have taken on key issues such as whether the national executive can remove the heads of provincial governments; whether the provincial executive has a role in national-level policies; whether provincial executives maintain any control over the military; and whether the provincial executives' powers can supersede the national executive's powers on certain regional issues.  State practice from the Middle East and North Africa region will be of particular relevance to PILPG's Libyan clients, but state practice examples will ultimately be selected based on their value in explaining or illustrating mechanisms and processes that shed light on the efficacy of different approaches to distributing powers between national and provincial executives.

Many critics from both the right and left are dissatisfied with the way that NEPA and its state analogues are being implemented, prompting some legislators to advocate statutory overrides and agency officials to expand the use of categorical exemptions.  Meanwhile, NEPA proponents are interested in making the environmental review process more user-friendly and efficient, while preserving its core disclosure requirements.  In this policy lab, students will review, analyze, and develop positions on potential NEPA reform options.

The EPA is currently in the process of writing New Source Performance Standards for new and existing coal and natural gas fired electric power plants. A critical question in writing these rules will be the extent to which EPA can allow for economically efficient approaches to cutting emissions. States, including California, industry, and environmental groups are all pushing EPA to incorporate some sort of emissions pricing as either a safe harbor or to propose it as a Federal Implementation Plan that States may choose to join. By doing so, not only will costs fall for regulated sectors but also, deeper cuts in emissions may become feasible. Almost all parties expect, based on prior precedent, that such a proposal will take the form of a cap-and-trade or at least some sort of mass-based cap on emissions.  Adele Morris, the Policy Director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution, has asked for our assistance in formulating and assessing the legal implications of an alternative proposal - a carbon tax. Students will prepare briefings and written comments to EPA and OMB explaining the potential benefits of a carbon tax approach to New Source Performance Standards as well as exploring the legal risks that might be created by this approach. We anticipate that students will also participate in briefings with key OMB and EPA Air and Radiation staff involved in drafting the proposed rule.  The New Source Performance Standard rulemaking for greenhouse gases is the most environmentally and economically significant regulatory effort that EPA will undertake this decade. Partnering with Brookings will allow us to both leverage legal and economic expertise and to inject students into the most exciting environmental policy making currently underway in the United States. Doing so now, before the draft rule is published, allows us to exert maximum influence before the agency loses flexibility to respond to outside input.  To develop skills relevant to the work of practicing lawyers, students will research and write parts of memos and written comments to EPA and OMB on behalf of Morris based on their research into various legal and policy aspects of Clean Air Act Section 111 as applied to the problem of power plant emissions. These assignments, for Writing (W) or Professional Writing (PW), or Research (R) credit, will be due before the end of the quarter.

Circuit struck down the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet rules. This policy practicum will help policy makers assess the available options in the wake of the court's decision.  In December 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the Open Internet Order, which enacted binding network neutrality rules for the first time. Network neutrality rules limit the ability of Internet service providers to interfere with the applications, content and services on their networks; they allow users to decide how they want to use the Internet without interference from Internet service providers.  In January of this year, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the core provisions of the Open Internet Order - the rules against blocking and discrimination. The decision combined two wins for the FCC with one decisive loss. According to the Court, the FCC has authority to regulate providers of broadband Internet access service under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the FCC's justification for the Open Internet Order is &quot;reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.&quot; The no-blocking and non-discrimination rules, the Court found, however, violate the Communications Act's ban on imposing common carrier obligations on entities like Internet service providers that the FCC has not classified as telecommunications service providers under Title II of the Communications Act.  As a result of this ruling, Internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T or Cox Cable that connect users to the Internet are now free to block any content, service or application they want. They can slow down selected applications, speed up others, or ask application or content providers like Netflix or Spotify to pay fees to reach their users. These practices would fundamentally change how we experience the Internet.  In the wake of the Court's decision, policy makers, stakeholders and observers are debating how to best ensure that the Internet remains open and free. Policy makers essentially have three options: First, the FCC can preserve the Open Internet Rules by reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Second, it can develop a different, narrower network neutrality regime under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act within the boundaries established by the Court of Appeal's decision. Finally, Congress or the FCC can adopt a new network neutrality regime, but only, in the case of the FCC, after reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service. In mid-February, the Federal Communications Commission opened a docket within which to consider how the Commission should proceed.  Special Instructions:  Upon consent of the instructor, students may choose enrollment Option 1 or Option 2:  Option 1 (3 units) - Students who elect Option 1 will research and write parts of white papers and comments to the Federal Communications Commission that will help policy makers assess the available options.  In special cases, students electing Option 1 may take the policy practicum for 2 units. Students interested in this option should indicate this on their application.  Option 2 (1 to 2 units) - In order to elect Option 2, students must concurrently enroll (with consent of instructor) in the seminar component, &quot;Current Issues in Network Neutrality&quot; (2 units), which meets Thursdays from 4:15pm-6:15pm.  Students in the policy practicum with the seminar component will research and write parts of white papers and comments to the Federal Communications Commission that will help policy makers assess the available options Students will be required to attend the seminar and participate in the discussion, but will not do any of the written assignments for the seminar.  Depending on the type of work in Option 1 or Option 2, students taking the policy practicum for two-units or more may receive professional writing (PW) or research (R) credit. Students must obtain the instructor's approval of their election to take the course for writing (PW or W) or research (R) credit.

Numerous state and local laws are also implicated by a potential lack of access for LEP court users. The California Commission on Access to Justice estimates that well over 7 million Californians, almost 20% of our state's population, &quot;cannot access the courts without significant language assistance, cannot understand pleadings, forms or other legal documents and cannot participate meaningfully in court proceedings.&quot; Through fieldwork, literature review, legal research, and interviews with relevant participants and stakeholders students will identify challenges facing LEP litigants.  Students will interview and consult with such parties as the Chief Justice, appellate court judges, state bar leaders and other attorneys, members of the Language Access Task Force of California, and individual stakeholders to develop recommendations for potential reform options, including whether the use of such technologies as video remote interpreting (VRI) can expand access to justice for LEP litigants.  Students will be asked to produce written materials (findings and recommendations) as well as make oral presentations to California judges, Judicial Council staff, and others at meetings at each quarter.

It is likely that with climate change, the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in some areas over the 21st century, and that the return interval of flood events will decrease, greatly increasing overall flood risk. Traditionally, flood mitigation has occurred through the use of hard engineering - seawalls, revetments and levees. However, natural habitats and ecosystems also offer significant, and often overlooked and undervalued protections in mitigating or buffering flood hazards. Hazard mitigation plans and conservation project plans very rarely explicitly recognize the protective value of natural habitats, even though this value has been well documented. Moreover, hazard mitigation agents and environmental conservation organizations seldom work together, although recent catastrophic events highlight why it would make sense to do so.  FEMA Region IX and The Nature Conservancy in California have recognized this and wish to develop a paradigm for working together to promote nature-based flood mitigation, and have asked for our help. Students in this practicum will: (a) Identify a coastal community with areas of both high flood risk and conservation value; (b) Design a nature-based strategy for risk reduction, which could include managed retreat and\/or other mitigation\/adaption tactics; (c) Identify available resources\/programs\/incentives for and barriers to implementation at the local, state and federal levels; (d) Design a process for enabling the community to avail themselves of these resources; and (e) Comment on how laws, regulations and programs could be changed to better facilitate nature-based flood risk reduction.  Students will also provide insight into the transferability of this approach beyond the study area.  Elements Used in Grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.

Law and medicine have been struggling to find ways to strike a balance between what the patients might want (or say they want), and what makes medical, economic, and ethical sense.  People have been encouraged to fill out &quot;Advanced Health Care Directives,&quot; which give guidance to doctors and surrogates (usually a family member) on what to do when faced with end-of-life dilemmas.  Another form, adopted in just over half the states (including California) is the POLST form (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment).  The two types are supposed to complement each other, but they are different in important ways.  The Advanced Health Care Directive expresses what a person wants, or thinks she wants, and\/or appoints a surrogate, in case the patient is unable to express her wishes.  Anybody can fill out a Directive, at any time of life.  Ideally, a copy goes to the surrogate, if one is appointed, and another to the primary care physician.  The POLST form is meant for people who are seriously ill.  It is a one page form, printed on bright pink paper.  It is signed by patient and doctor.  The directives (for example &quot;no artificial nutrition by tube&quot;) are supposed to be controlling; the patient, of course, can change her mind; but there is no surrogate.  It is an agreement between the patient and the doctor.  Who uses these forms?  How effective are they?  To what extent and in what situations are they useful?  In what situations are they not useful?  Can they be made more useful and, if so, how?  There has been research on the subject; and a major report on the end-of-life issue (originally due out in December) will be released this summer.  The class will look at some of this literature, but the main point will be to find out what local hospitals and nursing homes are doing.  Students will conduct interviews with doctors, nurses, and other health care specialists in order to find out what one might call the living law of the Directive and of Polst.  The aim is to get a more realistic picture of the situation in the area:  how are these forms used, when are they used, what has the experience of health care professionals been; perhaps also some insight into the experience of patients and family members.  The ultimately goal would, one hopes, be policy recommendations for improvements in the forms themselves, and the laws relating to the forms, along with  recommendations for ways to improve the way the forms are or can be used; or whether some entirely different approach to the problem might be needed.  Stanford Hospital and Clinics will be the client in researching and addressing the above questions.  Elements used in grading:  Final Paper.

Habitat mitigation is an important tool under a variety of environmental and wildlife protection statutes, both state and federal. Current regulatory frameworks usually require that habitat mitigation employ permanent easements or long-term contracts fixed in particular locations, despite the fact that species have changing habitat needs.  Many species are migratory and must move across the landscape to survive; a changing climate and shifting human activity only increase the dynamic nature of habitat needs.  To ensure that species and their habitat are protected in the most effective manner possible, legal and policy frameworks must be structured to address this and other challenges.  Additionally, there is a need for a robust market mechanism that recognizes the inherent natural capital and species habitat provided by working agricultural lands, and compensates landowners for the value of those resources.  In the face of significant upcoming conservation and mitigation needs for California, new policies and regulatory frameworks are necessary, and must be rooted in rigorous science, be consistent with existing legal frameworks, and accomplish the dual goals of promoting species recovery and maintaining agricultural production.  Students in the Law and Policy Lab will analyze cutting edge issues related to species habitat and protection.  They will help provide recommendations to the Central Valley Habitat Exchange (CVHE) in the development of more flexible and marketable habitat mitigation tools that can be used under a variety of programs, including the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, state wildlife laws, and the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.  The CVHE is a new initiative taking advantage of the emerging market of habitat credits by maximize the benefits of the habitat that willing agricultural landowners can provide. The CVHE will facilitate investment in conservation and restoration of vital and dynamic Central Valley floodplain and riparian habitat by promoting, monitoring and assisting in the exchange of habitat credits.  Students will tackle issues of permanence and change from legal, policy, economic, and scientific perspectives, depending on their existing skill set and research needs.  During the quarter, visitors from the CVHE Working Group - which includes members from national environmental non-profits, government agencies, and the private sector - will share their perspectives, and students will be invited to present their findings and make recommendations to help inform development of the CVHE.  The course will meet at a mutually convenient time that will be chosen after the quarter begins.  Meetings will include a mix of individual meetings and group meetings.

The project on the impacts of strategic litigation will examine how legal judgments - both positive and negative - and the ensuing record of implementation have influenced, together with other tools of change, the advancement of human rights in a variety of settings. Over the course of the Practicum, students will explore one or more of the following human rights themes: equal access to quality education, the death penalty, disability, housing rights, land rights and\/or state-sponsored violence\/torture. Cases will be drawn from domestic courts across the globe, as well as regional human rights tribunals and UN treaty bodies.  Specific questions to be examined include: What contributions to social, political and legal change has strategic litigation made on particular issues in particular places? What were the conditions, circumstances and manner in which litigation was pursued (in conjunction with other tools) which enhanced its contribution(s), and which diminished them? What does comparative experience teach about the risks and trade-offs involved in deciding whether, when and how to litigate so that it generates the strongest and most enduring impacts?

This strategy is based on a set of recommendations generated by a comprehensive interagency review of the U.S. government's capabilities mandated by Presidential Study Directive 10 (PSD-10) of 2011.  In unveiling this major new initiative, President Obama underscored that Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States.  Foundational to the PSD-10 recommendations was the creation of a high-level interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (APB) to monitor at-risk countries and emerging threats in order to coordinate the U.S. government's responses thereto.  The National Security Staff's Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights convenes the APB. Since being established in 2012, the APB has worked to amass and strengthen a range of legal, diplomatic, military, rhetorical, and financial tools for atrocity prevention. Although the APB is a U.S. initiative, it also aims to build multilateral support around the imperative of prevention, working with the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, regional organizations such as the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and committed partner states, such as Tanzania, Switzerland, and Argentina.  The proposed policy lab would support the APB primarily through one of its constitutive entities, the Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ) in the U.S. Department of State.  GCJ is headed by an Ambassador-at-Large (Assistant Secretary equivalent) and a Deputy (a position I held from 2012-2013) and advises the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights on U.S. policy addressed to the prevention of, responses to, and accountability for mass atrocities.  Additional client agencies and offices will include the Department of Justice, the National Security Council, the Department of the Treasury, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other State Department Offices, such as the Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy &amp; Labor and the Bureau of International Organizations.  Depending on student interest, I envision the lab taking on a range of projects devoted to (a) strengthening existing tools, (b) developing new capabilities, (c) evaluating the efficacy of past efforts in order to glean lessons learned, and (d) gathering best practices from other states and entities engaged in similar endeavors, all with an eye toward developing concrete recommendations for future action. 1.  Regulating the Transfer of Arms in the Service of Atrocities Prevention: In 2013, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), regulating the international trade in conventional arms (which include everything from small arms to battle tanks, combat aircraft, and warships).  According to Article 6(3) of the treaty, States Parties (of which there are now 40) are barred from authorizing the transfer of covered conventional weapons if officials have knowledge that the arms would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. States Parties are obliged to take measures to implement the provisions of the treaty, including through an effective and transparent national control system.  In September 2013, the United States signed the treaty but the President has not yet submitted it for ratification. This project would devise proposals for how states can best implement their treaty duties under Article 6(3) with an eye toward generating model regulatory language based on analogous treaty regimes. 2.  Designing Commissions of Inquiry in Support of Accountability: The Under-Secretary of Civilian Security, Human Rights, and Democracy would benefit from advice on how to maximize the impact of the commissions of inquiry (COIs) that are established, usually by the Human Rights Council in Geneva but occasionally by the U.N. Security Council, to document the commission of international crimes in armed conflicts and repressive states. The project would collate the various mandates, methodologies, outcomes, and impact of prior (and current) COIs with an eye toward developing best practices and recommending ways that future COIs can be designed to better contribute to processes of accountability for the crimes they document and the perpetrators they identify. In particular, students would propose options for better leveraging lists of perpetrators for accountability purposes, such as by sharing with national immigration and prosecutorial officials. 3.  According and Withholding Foreign Official Immunity: The Department of Justice (Human Rights &amp; Special Prosecutions Unit) is keenly interested in gaining a better understanding of the principles of immunity governing foreign officials. Although they would welcome any up-to-date guidance on background legal principles, they are hoping in particular to get more clarity on the actual practice of states in claiming, and according, such immunities, including the historical practice of the United States. The research and recommendations on when the according of immunity should be resisted would inform their prosecutorial practice vis-&agrave;-vis state actors accused of the commission of international crimes as well as their negotiations with the Department of State with respect to assertions\/suggestions of immunity. 4.  Surveying the Efforts of Others: A number of other states, multilateral entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and United Nations offices are also devoted to preventing atrocities in at-risk or volatile states and to inhibiting the escalation of violence once underway.  Although the APB is committed to working multilaterally, it has yet to undertake a comprehensive survey of policies developed by other governments and non-governmental entities in this regard.  This project would gather this information in order to identify partnership opportunities and identify policies worthy of emulation.  As with all policy labs, students would develop a more fulsome project proposal and work plan with the client entity and prepare mid-term and final reports.  The proposed projects, and others that might be developed, will give students the opportunity to develop an expertise in: * elements of U.S. foreign policy, * the challenges of interagency and multilateral coordination, * the process of designing and implementing governmental aid and programming, *techniques of treaty interpretation and implementation, * the packaging legal constraints in policy terms, * developing valid metrics for evaluating successes and failures in circumstances characterized by acute uncertainty and multiple variables, and * comparative law and policy.  Over the course of the semester, students should improve specific policy analysis skills (e.g., research design, data collection and analysis, and policy writing) as well as general professional skills (analytical thinking, project management, client relations, teamwork, and oral presentation). Because the APB is a new interagency initiative, with no clear precedent, the policy lab will also offer students a blue ski opportunity to think creatively about ways the U.S. government can balance the equities of its various agencies -- and inspire international partners -- to respond effectively to the pressing global challenge of preventing mass atrocities.

The California prison system remains under federal court control for unconstitutional overcrowding, and the federal court is loath to terminate the injunction without some reassurance of reforms that might prevent the overcrowding from recurring. In the absence of a state sentencing commission, the Chief Justice believes that we at Stanford  can perform a fresh new analysis of the parts of the Penal Code that most merit review, in terms of their undue complexity, their arguably disproportionate  severity, and the possibility that they are major drivers of the size of the prison population. Enhancements are an incredibly complex part of the Penal Code. Tens of provisions, many of them obscure even to judges, allow for very large upgrades to sentences  because of aspects of conduct that are said to aggravate the underlying crime. (Please note that while some of the enhancements under review involve prior crimes,  we are not dealing with the Three Strikes Law.)  The Chief Justice's administrative arm,  the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), acknowledges  that no one has performed even a statutory analysis  of the overall scheme of  enhancements, much less any empirical effort to connect them to prison inputs. This will likely be a multi-term Policy Lab that will ultimately gather data to attempt this  empirical analysis, but the first term effort is more circumscribed. A team of students will undertake the mapping of the statutory terrain - a charting of all the enhancements in the Penal Code and the many cross-permutations of these enhancements and the crimes to which they attach, and as a first empirical cut, identification of the permutations of crime and enhancements that are most often charged in California.

Many of the agencies operating in the energy and environmental sphere have overlapping jurisdictions, but they also have different missions, priorities, and resources that push them toward agency-specific policies and programs and away from cross-cutting, government-wide initiatives. The result has been sub-optimal federal implementation of clean energy solutions, responses to climate change, the coordination of regulatory and permitting activity, and the like. In this SPRING QUARTER policy lab (3 units), students will work with the  Center for American Progress (CAP) and the Office of Management &amp; Budget in Washington to scope out the governance challenge and to review and analyze administrative tools (e.g., Executive Orders; Presidential Memoranda; inter-agency Task Forces; budget-led initiatives, etc.) that have been used to address it. Students will develop candid assessments of successes and failures and seek to identify common ingredients that may help predict the efficacy of cross-agency efforts. The policy lab will produce a report to CAP that should assist future Administrations in deploying more effective administrative governance tools in the energy and environmental arena.

Many of its decisions (both adjudicatory decisions and regulations) are of enormous importance to the California economy.  The proceedings to adopt these decisions are often lengthy and complex.  The CPUC is interested in working with the Stanford Law and Policy Lab to consider procedural reforms to promote transparency and efficiency in its decisionmaking.  There are three areas of potential procedural reform that the Policy Lab might consider.  Which of the areas are selected for study will be decided after discussion between the CPUC, the supervising professor, and students enrolled in the practicum.  i) Ex parte communication rules.  Ex parte communications between outsiders and PUC  decisionmakers are prohibited in adjudicatory cases; permitted in ratemaking cases but must be disclosed; and permitted in rulemaking without disclosure.  Some CPUC decisionmakers believe that ex parte communications are essential to enable them to properly consider different points of view and to facilitate timely decisionmaking.  Others view such communications as inherently unreliable and as undermining the transparency and accountability of the agency.  The CPUC is interested in studying this problem and considering amendments to relevant statutes and regulations.  ii) Open Meetings law.  The Bagley Keene Act requires the CPUC to conduct open meetings when a quorum of its 5 commissioners meet.  Bagley Keene has, in practice, effectively prevented the CPUC from properly managing its operations and engaging in useful deliberation.  The CPUC and the Little Hoover Commission are considering whether to seek an amendment to Bagley Keene in order to permit more coordination and collaboration among CPUC Commissioners.  iii) Evidence rules.  The &quot;residuum rule&quot; requires that on judicial review of an agency decision, the record must contain at least some evidence, other than hearsay, to support the agency's findings and conclusions.  A recent court decision has said the CPUC is subject to the residuum rule because it has been declared CPUC policy.  A variety of evidence (such as studies by other government agencies) often comprise the underpinning of CPUC decisions and may not come under any hearsay exception.  As a result, the residuum rule could compromise the efficiency of CPUC proceedings and risk reversal of future decisions on technical evidentiary grounds.  The CPUC is interested in investigating potential solutions for remedying this problem.  This practicum will carry two units of credit.  It will be supervised by Visiting Professor Michael Asimow.  Students will be expected to do field work and legal research and write a paper that makes policy proposals in one or more of the three areas discussed above.  Enrollment is limited to three students and will be graded under the H\/P\/R\/F system.  Grades will be based on the level of a student's participation and the quality of the final paper.

An increasing number of business enterprises in developing countries, including India and much of Africa, seek to provide health, sanitation, housing, savings, insurance, and other essential services to the very poor. But many of them operate in countries that lack stable property rights, independent judiciaries, and other elements of the &quot;rule of law&quot; that investors and entrepreneurs take for granted in more developed countries.  We will study how entrepreneurs operate and attract investors in these situations. The first phase of the project will involve in-depth interviews with and data gathering from foundations, funds, and other institutional investors who have a sophisticated knowledge of the conditions that conduce to the success of their investee enterprises and a return on their investments. Our client will likely be a foundation or other organization making impact investments in developing countries.

Gentrification can improve neighborhoods that suffer from underinvestment, but it can also cause the displacement of long term residents, cherished landmarks and long standing businesses and it can make neighborhoods homogenous, sterile and less able to meet the day to day needs of their residents.  A gentrifying city can be a city in the process of losing the variety and dynamism that made it attractive to investors and successful people in the first place.  And of course, gentrifying cities are unaffordable to low income residents.  Because of rising rents, many neighborhoods in San Francisco are already unable to sustain such businesses as dry cleaners, laundry services, drug stores and affordable restaurants.  A neighborhood with nothing but fancy wine bars, chic clothing shops, gourmet restaurants and trendy coffee houses selling $5 drip coffee is not in crisis, but a city with only such neighborhoods arguably is.  We will work with the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Community and Economic Development on various issues related to the challenges of gentrification in San Francisco.  Issues include researching policy responses to the displacement of legacy businesses and non-profit enterprises and analyzing the effects of rising property values and rents on the diversity of businesses in San Francisco neighborhoods.  Students interested in this policy lab should submit a C\/V and statement of interest, to be reviewed by Professor Ford and San Francisco city officials.

With a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, SPARQ is developing techniques to improve people's health by changing mindsets in culturally appropriate ways. The project, Changing Mindsets to Build Cultures of Health, targets the mindsets not only of patients, but also of healthcare practitioners. For example, one study examines how changing practitioners' mindsets affects their online communications with patients and, in turn, patients' behaviors and health.  Working closely with SPARQ as a client, the practicum investigates legal issues in changing doctor and patient mindsets. For example, can patients consent to knowing more or less about their doctors' expectations? How much can doctors' curate their findings and opinions for the sake of their patients? (How might a patient consent, for instance, to being given a placebo when detailed knowledge that it is a placebo destroys the placebo effect?) With the advent of electronic medical records (EMR), how much information are healthcare practitioners legally required to share with their patients and should they push to share as much as they are permitted to in all circumstances? Practicum participants will work on a multidisciplinary team with SPARQ faculty, grad students, and staff to develop a memo analyzing relevant legal questions and precedents and may also advise the design of behavioral experiments.

There are numerous possible explanations for this discrepancy, but one trend may help to account for at least some of it: immigrants in state prisons and jails may be deemed ineligible for certain rehabilitative programs and other sentencing alternatives on the basis of their citizenship status.  The purpose of this policy lab is to determine whether and to what extent immigrants in California prisons and jails are excluded from access to rehabilitative programs that function as alternatives to incarceration on the basis of citizenship status.  Students will do research to document the existence of such exclusions as a matter of policy and\/or practice, and work with Professors Jayashri Srikantiah and Jennifer Chac&oacute;n and the ACLU of Southern California to draft legislation to prevent noncitizens from being unnecessarily excluded from such programs.  This policy lab is offered for three units in Autumn Quarter and two units in Winter Quarter.  Elements used in grading: Written research and drafting assignments.

Among the key players in these pay-for-success (PFS), or social impact bond (SIB) programs are investors who provide working capital to service providers and are repaid to the extent that providers achieve agreed-upon outcomes. The typical investment &quot;stack&quot; consists of for-profit investors and foundations that make grants or invest at concessionary rates and absorb first losses if the provider fails to perform.  This practicum will consider the variety of strategies and instruments for financing social impact bonds, examining the entire spectrum of investments, optimal investment structures, the role of investors in monitoring service providers, and the role of intermediaries in structuring and placing these financial instruments.  Thus far, these arrangements have been one-off, or bespoke, requiring individual crafting that makes them difficult if not impossible to scale. Major barriers to scaling include (1) the transaction costs of negotiating agreements among non-concessionary commercial investors, foundations, and individual philanthropists to assemble the capital necessary to finance a program, and (2) identifying success metrics that are sufficiently clear, measurable, evidence-based, and &quot;non-game-able&quot;  that investors can invest with reasonable certainty.  We will initially focus on the problem of outcome metrics. Although such metrics are inevitably specific to different social program--e.g., youth recidivism and early childhood education--it may be possible to develop metrics that are useable by different government entities adopting similar sorts of programs across the United States. In addition, the early stages of a program financed by a social impact bond may create uncertainties with respect, say, to the processes of enrolling participants. To explore these issues, we will draw on existing examples of SIBs, on the social science literature (and experts) in particular fields, and on the expertise of organizations including Third Sector Capital Partners, Social Finance US, the Nonprofit Finance Fund, and the Social Impact Bond Technical Assistance Lab at Harvard's Kennedy School.  Our client will be the Nonprofit Finance Fund, founded in 1980, which helps organizations connect money to mission effectively, and supports innovations such as growth capital campaigns, cross-sector economic recovery initiatives and impact investing.

They set standards for how companies present terms, conditions, and other legal information to people, in the hope that communicating these terms will educate people sufficiently to make wise decisions. But are these disclosures actually comprehensible, engaging, or effective? Anecdotally, we all know that most people ignore the fine print, click through online disclosures without reading them, and trash the paperwork that come along with products or account statements.  In this Policy Lab, we will experiment with how these very important disclosures could be improved, with better designs that could make the information more understandable, more engaging, and more actionable for normal people.  We will partner with the financial regulator FINRA, as they grapple with a specific disclosure use case: when financial companies advertise their products to people via print, web, mobile, and television, how can they effectively communicate the terms and risks of these financial products? What kind of disclosure design -- with more visuals, with more interactivity, or with tech-enabled communication -- could be a new standard for helping people make smart decisions about financial products?  During the Policy Lab, our team of students will work with FINRA leaders to understand their current disclosure design requirements for financial companies and their rule-making process as they set new regulations for advertising disclosures. We will understand the needs and requirements of the regulators, the financial companies, and the different target users, and then use the design process to generate new proposed models for disclosures and then test them with qualitative and quantitative evaluation. We will submit this research and these new models to FINRA to be used as they define standards for securities firms communicating with the general public.

The overall goal of the study is to assess the functioning of various aspects of California's water management system during the current drought and to develop tools and policy recommendations to help the state survive future droughts with fewer economic and environmental impacts.  California is currently in its fourth year of drought.  The drought's duration, along with increased temperatures due to climate change, have combined to make it perhaps the most intense drought since we have begun keeping records.  These conditions have placed enormous strains on water management systems at all levels of government.  The state's water rights system (among other laws) has had to cope with unprecedented hydrologic conditions, conflicting demands for water, and data gaps.  As a result, state and federal water management agencies have faced unprecedented decisions along with untested rules for making those decisions.  The overall PPIC study, including the work of the practicum, will seek to evaluate the performance of the state's institutions, management systems, infrastructure, and laws during these extreme conditions in order to make recommendations to better prepare California for future droughts.  The practicum will focus primarily on the California water rights system and its interaction with other laws related to water quality and aquatic species protection in the context of the ongoing drought. Issues for research include case studies of the effectiveness of different legal mechanisms for protecting streamflows and aquatic species from conditions related to extreme drought. They may also include an analysis of temporary urgency change petitions (a mechanism to temporarily suspend water quality based limitations on water rights) during the drought, including their rationale and their effects on water quality.  The practicum will contribute some written analysis a series of reports to be produced by PPIC.  Students will also participate in planning and holding a workshop of experts that will help shape the project and its outputs.  The practicum will accept up to eight students.

They recognize the unique needs of veterans who get entangled in the criminal justice system, and endeavor to provide more effective resources to treat their problems than the traditional criminal justice system ordinarily provides. Despite their growth and popularity, little is known about their effectiveness, particularly in the target population they reach. We are partnering with Congressman Seth Moulton and the Massachusetts veterans court program on an ambitious and interesting project to understand who is excluded from veterans treatment courts (VTCs), why, and whether there are ways to help them too. We will work closely with the Commonwealth  to collect and review information on veterans in the criminal justice system, and veterans who are in or have gone through VTCs, for the purpose of understanding the population and gaining insight into who truly benefits from the courts and who is excluded. We will use techniques used in evaluating mental health and other specialty courts to assess the VTCs and develop recommendations for expanding their reach to at least some of those who are currently excluded but who could benefit from them. The information we gather and develop into a report will be useful to the many jurisdictions that already host veterans treatment courts, as well as to those considering their adoption.

These numbers represent a long-standing problem for U.S. law firms.  For over 30 years,  50% of law school graduates have been women, yet only 18% of law firm equity partners are women.  What's more, that partnership number has remained relatively fixed for much of that time.  In the National Association of Women Lawyers' first annual survey in 2006, women constituted 15% of equity partners.  Despite a recognition of and focus on this issue, law firms have not been able to move the needle.  Conventional methods haven't worked.  The profession needs new ideas - creative and innovative ways to retain and advance women in private law firms.  Students selected for this course will work together to produce a policy paper analyzing this issue.  Research will focus on two major areas: (1) the possible reasons for the low retention rates and partnership percentage; and (2) innovative ideas both inside and outside the legal profession for retaining and advancing women.  The paper will be used to advise participants in the inaugural Women in Law Hackathon.  The Hackathon is a Shark-Tank style pitch competition co-created by Diversity Lab and SLS. 54 high-level partners from top U.S. law firms and nine SLS students will work together (virtually) in teams of seven from January to June 2016 to innovate new means of advancing and retaining women in the legal profession, particularly those in private sector law firms. The teams will then present their ideas in person to a panel of judges at a pitch event at SLS on June 24, 2016.  The top three winning teams will grant the prize money donated by Bloomberg Law (1st place $10,000, 2nd place $7,500, 3rd place $5,000) to their choice of a non-profit organization that is advancing women in the legal profession and beyond.  The winning ideas will be published on Diversity Lab's and SLS's websites and distributed to major news publications and top management at U.S. law firms.  Our hope is that some or all of these ideas will be adopted by firms across the U.S.  Students may also elect to participate as a team member in the Hackathon.  Time commitment of team members is approximately 2-3 hours per month (via phone) from January through June 2016, plus the 1.5-day in-person pitch competition June 23-24, 2016 at SLS.  Funding is available to cover domestic travel costs for students to return from summer internships to participate in the competition.  Maximum enrollment: 9. Preference will be given to those students who would like to participate in both the practicum and the Hackathon.  Students will receive 3 credits for this one-quarter &quot;R&quot; class.

Our project will be to interview about 25 international mediators through survey and structured interviews, from which we can pinpoint the enforcement issues that emerge, and develop a series of illustrative cases. This research would require IRB review; our project for spring quarter will be to schedule and conduct the interviews. Both the Legal Office of UNCITRAL and U.S. State Department are available for advice. The UNCITRAL working group will be meeting in September in Vienna, so we anticipate that our work will be a useful input to the overall education of the delegates to ensure that the convention provisions align with the needs of practice.

The client has asked us to survey best practices around the nation, to think boldly and imaginatively about how best to protect against both the reality and the perception of bias, and to make recommendations that can be presented not only to the client but also, potentially, to other local and state officials in California for adoption statewide. Among the questions we will consider is the whether and when a criminal investigation into an officer-involved shooting should stay at the county level, be conducted by state officials, or be handled by investigators and\/or prosecutors from other California counties.

Despite the initiation of democratic reforms since 2010 and the release of many political prisoners, Burma continues to violate the human rights of prisoners.  Currently, Burma's prison system does not meet the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and the state has started debating a draft Prison Law to conform to these basic standards.  While the law addresses many of the Burmese prison system's most egregious violations of the Standard Minimum Rules, many civil society activists have criticized the draft law for failing to meet their demands and ensure the protection of prisoners and adherence to international standards.  The Public Interest Law and Policy Group (&quot;PILPG&quot;), a pro bono international law firm, is providing legal assistance to Burmese civil society organization to develop effective advocacy campaigns and to draft legislation and policy proposals.  Students in this Practicum will provide guidance to PILPG in support of its work with its Burmese Civil society clients.  Students in this Practicum will focus in particular on assisting Burmese civil society organizations advocating for legal reforms to the state's prison system.  Students will research and prepare a memorandum analyzing the prison laws and regulations in states within the South Asian (ASEAN) region. This memorandum will provide examples of how states have incorporated the relevant international legally binding human rights instruments as well as key nonbinding international standards on the treatment of prisoners into their domestic legal framework.

The international community has fitfully pursued efforts to organize negotiations to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  One major coalition of Syrian opposition groups, known as the Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, or the Syrian National Coalition (&quot;the Coalition&quot;), has been working actively to develop positions in anticipation of negotiations to end the conflict and create a transitional Syrian government.  As the Coalition plans for a post-Assad transition, it has sought the guidance of the Public Interest Law and Policy Group (&quot;PILPG&quot;), a pro bono international law firm, to advise it on a range of legal and policy issues.  Students in this Practicum will provide guidance to PILPG in support of its work with the Coalition.  Students in the Practicum will focus in particular on the issue of presidential powers during the hoped-for transitional period.  The Coalition is increasingly concerned that any political settlement will leave Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power during the transitional period; the Coalition accordingly is interested in exploring mechanisms for limiting presidential powers, particularly during a period of fundamental political transition.  Students in the Practicum will examine a series of recent transitional episodes from other post-conflict settings to identify the legal and institutional approaches that have been devised to limit the power of particular executive branch actors or groups, or have subjected presidential power to supervening institutional constraints (either internal or external).  The memorandum developed during the course of this project will also assess the efficacy of those transitional arrangements and provide suggestions, to the extent possible, as to which might prove effective in the Syrian context.

They will explore how the initiatives were structured and how successful they were in producing the desired results. Particular attention will be devoted to the mechanisms used to facilitate coordination across agencies and with the White House, and to measure outcomes.  The final product will be a paper that reviews the students' case studies and that offers recommendations on how to improve the performance of the federal government in implementing initiatives that require coordination across multiple agencies.

One of the biggest challenges facing the legal system is how many people are trying to navigate it without a lawyer - particularly for problems like divorce, child custody, personal debt, housing, and small claims. It is a problem for the courts -  because it requires huge amounts of resources to support lay people who are unfamiliar with court procedures and often get things &quot;wrong&quot;, causing efficiency and cost problems. It is also a problem for the lay people going through the courts. They are trying to solve major life problems using the legal system, but the system is confusing, expensive, and frustrating, so that they cannot use the system effectively and feel a lack of procedural justice.  This class proposes that a user-centered design approach, mixed with an agile development approach, can increase the amount of procedural justice for self-represented litigants in the California courts. User-centered design involves taking the lay person's point of view of a complex system, and then creating new services, products, and policies that fit their mental models and empower them to navigate the system. Agile development means creating new services, products, and policies through rough and quick prototypes, testing them with target stakeholders and subject matter experts immediately, and then iterating and refining repeatedly until they are ready to formally launch.  In this class, the students will learn how to practice agile user-centered design by creating new interventions for California Courts - Self-Help Centers, service centers located inside the court to help people without a lawyer to understand their legal options, create a strategy, and pursue a legal process. The class is partnered with the California Judicial Council, that administers these Self-Help Centers, and the Self-Help Centers in the Santa Clara and San Mateo court systems.  The class will involve fieldwork -  in the form of rapid prototyping and testing -- at these two courts' Self-Help Centers. Students will work in teams to identify key failpoints and frustrations of the stakeholders of the Centers by conducting interviews and observations there, brainstorming new solutions to empower the lay people, and testing these new solutions to identify which are worth pursuing and how to improve them. Students will then present their proposed solutions, insights, and user research and testing feedback to the courts and Judicial Council for them to use as they set new policies and programs to improve Access to Justice.  The fieldwork sessions will be combined with seminars in which the students learn about innovations in access to justice, agile design and development approaches to problem solving, with readings and guest  experts. Students will meet leaders of new initiatives to improve access to justice using improved visual design, technology tools, and changes to policy and regulation.  In the class, students will gain skills in design and product development, conducting user research, project management, and policy analysis. The class welcomes students with experience in technology development and design work, but it is not required. The class is open to non-law students as well.

In legislation passed last session, CAISO was authorized to evaluate an expansion of its territory to include out of state entities within its day-ahead and real-time markets. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, owner of PacificCorps and NV Energy, and Arizona Public Service have both expressed interest in joining an expanded CAISO organized wholesale electricity market provided that new governance arrangements can be agreed. Such a move would have major implications for California's climate policies in at least four ways. First and most importantly, integration of a larger footprint into the California electricity market will do much to facilitate least-cost addition of renewable resources to achieve California's 50% RPS target. Second, California has spent the last decade easing its utilities out of a dependence on out of state coal plants. This process might be derailed if these units were included within the CAISO footprint. Third, California's GHG cap-and-trade has a complex process for tracking imported coal-fired energy. This process might be far more difficult or even impossible were these units included in the CAISO footprint. Fourth, joint governance of the electricity market might push all parties toward regional collaboration on cap-and-trade, but this might dilute California's climate change efforts across states unwilling to make similar commitments. The goal of the policy lab will be to evaluate these and other implications of CAISO expansion and to articulate potential options for managing the interaction between it and California's ambitious climate policies. The client for the Policy Lab is Kevin de Leon, the Senate pro Tem of the California Legislature. Our goal will be to insure that de Leon, and other parties involved in the negotiation, fully understand the implications of the choices they make as this complex process unfolds.

In this seminar, students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing reform in California as a case study in the history, politics, practical considerations and legal regulation of sentencing and &quot;mass incarceration&quot; in the United States. Students will also test their skills in the field by assisting with the representation of individual inmates sentenced to long prison terms for nonviolent crimes and engaging in active criminal justice policy analysis and advocacy.  Over the five years, no other state has implemented more reforms to reduce its prison and jail populations than California. The Project has been intimately involved in this movement, leading ballot measures that implemented legislative reforms to reduce prison sentences and representing individual prisoners sentenced to life for nonviolent crimes under California's &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law. Based on this experience, the Project was recently asked by the White House to support prisoners who receive sentence commutations from the President. Students enrolled in the seminar are involved in all aspects of the Project's work.  Student casework involves assistance with different stages of ongoing litigation in state and federal court. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigation in the field, and draft petitions on our clients' behalf. Students will also contribute to ongoing policy work to ensure the effective implementation of reforms impacting our clients, which include individual prisoners and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.  The Project is an active, fast-paced organization that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in this seminar. This course offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law and to hone practical litigation and advocacy skills in and out of the courtroom. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week. Students will also meet for 1 hour individually and in teams with Project director Mike Romano each week to discuss their work on their projects.  CONSENT APPLICATION: Interested students must apply to enroll in the seminar by sending a one-page statement of interest and resume by email with the subject line &quot;application&quot; to Mike Romano (mromano@stanford.edu).

They affect industries ranging from traditional manufacturing to high tech start-ups; they also play a role in consumer loans (and help explain the movie &quot;Repo Man&quot;). The course focuses primarily on Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, but also considers the federal Bankruptcy Code, the federal intellectual property statutes, and other state and federal laws. nBankruptcy is the first of three courses (the other two are Secured Credit and Payment Systems) dealing with the financing of commercial ventures through means other than the sale of corporate stock. These courses may be taken in any order: neither presupposes any knowledge of the others.

Among the movements likely to be studied are different phases in the movement for black civil rights, the women's equality movements of the early and late 20th century, the labor movement before and during the New Deal, and the movements for LGBT rights of the present time.

Transactions should be tailored to the goals and circumstances of each set of parties, but there are some general principles that can guide the design process. This seminar examines some of these principles: such as the use of embedded options in contracts, of third parties, and of tailored procedures for dispute resolution and enforcement. Some of the readings and discussion will be at a fairly high level of abstraction, drawing on economic and sociological theories of contracting.  The rest will closer to ground level, looking at particular types of transactions, such as franchising, construction, joint ventures, or start-up financing. We will also look at the process of innovation in contract design, including the role of lawyers and digital document production. Students will be required to write paper for the seminar, and encouraged to focus on a specific type of transaction.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Written work, editing of other student's written work, attendance, class and moot court participation.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"R -Research Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"RESEARCH"}],"class_id":16397,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.

Although the course will focus on United States law and policy, insights from the course are applicable to water regimes throughout the world, and we will occasionally look at law and policy elsewhere in the world for comparison.

The class will explore the substantive issues related to equality and inequality as well develop written and oral skills for advocacy, including drafting op-eds, position papers, and other written materials and preparing for oral presentations.  Each student will be responsible for leading at least one class at San Quentin State Prison to a mixed class composed of Stanford and San Quentin prisoner students.

You already know how to think like a lawyer, but if you are interested in policymaking, policy advocacy or policy research&iquest;whether in the public, nonprofit, or corporate sector&iquest; you need to know how to think like a policy analyst as well.  This seminar, designed primarily for students beginning or continuing in Policy Lab practicums, has three purposes.  First, it introduces students to the ways in which policy analysts approach public policy problems and controversies, focusing on perspectives that distinguish policy analysis from traditional legal analysis Second, it introduces students to the tools of policy analysis, including approaches to collecting and analyzing information Third, it provides hand-on lessons on communicating with policy makers orally and in writing.  There is no text for the course. Readings for the course will include examples of policy analyses conducted to inform public policymaking.  Students engaged in policy practicums will use their practicum experience as a basis  for assessing the value of various policy analytic perspectives and research approaches.  Students not engaged in policy practicums will pick a policy problem they are interested in and develop a plan for conducting a policy analysis relevant to this problem.

For example, why is cable television so expensive? Why can comedians swear on cable TV, but not on broadcast TV? Should regulators care as much about violence as they do about indecency? Can we trust the market to give the audience what it wants? Will the market provide content that is in the public interest, such as local news or educational programming, or do regulators need to intervene?  Should we care if media outlets are increasingly owned by a few small conglomerates? And how does the Internet affect the need for ownership regulation?

About 60% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. The new Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a free trade agreement currently under negotiation between the EU and the U.S., will further strengthen substantially the economic ties between the EU and the U.S. in the near future. In the past few years, even several proposed mergers between U.S. companies have been killed solely by the EU antitrust authorities, although approved by the U.S. antitrust regulators. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers. Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts. Secondly, we will explore the legal framework of doing business in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital and persons, (b) EU competition\/antitrust law, as well as (c) EU e-commerce law. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU. Additional education and research opportunities for students in EU law, building on this course, can be found in the course syllabus.

Perhaps as a result, electric utilities are among the most heavily regulated of large firms. This statutory and regulatory framework is composed of a complex patchwork of overlapping state and federal rules that is constantly evolving to meet emerging challenges to the energy system. In this course, students will acquire a basic understanding of the law of rate-based regulation of utilities. We will then examine the history of natural gas pipeline regulation in the United States, concluding with the introduction of market competition into US natural gas markets and the advent of shale gas. Next, we will cover the basics of the electricity system, including consumer demand, grid operations, and power plant technologies and economics. We will then revisit cost of service rate regulation as it has been applied in the electricity context. Next we will examine reform of both rate-regulated and wholesale market-based structures, focusing on various attempts to introduce market competition into aspects of the industry and to strengthen incentives for utility investment in energy efficiency. Finally, students will examine various approaches to subsidization of utility scale renewable energy and the growth of distributed energy. Throughout, the course will focus on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing, but ever evolving federal and state roles in regulating the supply of electric power. Students will write two 1000 word response papers to questions related to readings and outside speakers in addition to taking a final exam.

Because there is a preference for local civil and criminal SEP placements (see Law 474 and Law 475), your SCEP proposal must explain (a) how it meets the goals of the externship program; and (b) why a similar project cannot be accomplished in one of the placements offered in the Bay Area.  SCEP placements outside the Bay Area must be full-time. Students wishing to undertake a SCEP placement obtain the supervision of a faculty member who will oversee their externship and an accompanying tutorial.

Because of other Law School requirements, students in their final quarter are limited to part-time externships of no more than 16 hours per week.  For a complete description of the Civil SEP, students should read the Externship Handbook, which is available from the Levin Center for Public Service and Public Interest Law or online at: http:\/\/www.law.stanford.edu\/organizations\/programs-and-centers\/john-and-terry-levin-center-for-public-service-and-public-interest-law\/externship-program-0 .

Externship Program (SEP) allows second and third year students to work for credit in criminal prosecutors' and defenders' offices in the Bay Area for one quarter.  Placements can be either full time (40 hours per week) or part-time, but no fewer than 16 hours per week.  Because of other Law School requirements, students in their final quarter are limited to part-time externships of no more than 16 hours per week.  For a complete description of the Criminal SEP, students should read the Externship Handbook, which is available from the Levin Center for Public Service and Public Interest Law or online at: http:\/\/www.law.stanford.edu\/organizations\/programs-and-centers\/john-and-terry-levin-center-for-public-service-and-public-interest-law\/externship-program-0 .  Students wishing to enroll in an externship must meet various requirements that are set out in the Handbook. Interested students should speak to Jory Steele, Lecturer in Law and Director of Externship and Pro Bono Programs at jsteele@law.stanford.edu.  Students participating in the Criminal SEP must also concurrently enroll in the Externship Companion Seminar.  In some cases, where other seminars would be more appropriate companion courses for a student's placement, the student can request to substitute a different course in the application process.

We will also examine the operation of international law in the U.S. legal system.

This transformation will not happen automatically. Technical, legal and economic choices will affect whether the Internet can realize its potential or not. Communications law - the law that governs both the physical infrastructures for communications services such as cable and telephone networks as well as the communication services which are provided over these infrastructures - has become one of the most important arenas in which choices affecting the future of the information society are made. The debates over network neutrality (whether network providers should be able to restrict the applications and content that their Internet service customers can access over the network) or the right ways to foster broadband deployment are examples of this trend.  At the same time, the Internet's ability to support a variety of different communications services such as telephony, information services or video over the same physical network infrastructure challenges the existing communications law, which is based on the assumption that different physical infrastructures offer different communications services.  What are the features of the Internet that are at the core of its economic, social, cultural and political potential? What can regulators and legislators do to allow the Internet to realize this potential? And how can they allow applications like Internet telephony and traditional telephony to coexist without giving one an unfair advantage over the other? The course will address how current law deals with these questions, but also explore what regulators and legislators may do to better deal with the challenges posed by the Internet. The course is mostly focused on the US, but highlights developments elsewhere where appropriate.

Students will be asked to apply cases and legal principles in various practical situations that may arise in a transactional litigation practice. Familiarity with basic corporate law principles is assumed.  Classes and readings.  The first segment of the course will introduce basic doctrinal principles of M&amp;A law and provide an introduction to the litigator's role in the transactional setting. The remaining sessions will revolve around three detailed M&amp;A case studies, with seminar members divided into group roles. The first week of each case study will involve the negotiation and structuring of an M&amp;A transaction. The second week will involve litigation relating to the transaction. Reading for these sessions will include case scenarios, supporting materials, and additional relevant case law and articles. The attendance and active participation of seminar members is essential. Readings for all classes will be provided in spiral-bound volumes distributed in class.  Written assignments and grading. Students will be expected to (i) write a final paper; (ii) prepare two additional short written assignments associated with the case study assignments (such as marking up draft documents or preparing court papers); and (iii) participate actively in class.  Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02) which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

We will examine federal court decisions defining reproductive rights, including cases involving conflicts between reproductive freedom, religious liberty and freedom of speech.  We will consider the limits of federal constitutional protection for vulnerable communities, such as teenagers, inmates and women with public insurance.  In light of those limitations, we will consider alternative strategies to strengthen reproductive freedom: state constitutional litigation, legislation, administrative advocacy, communications, organizing and initiative campaigns.  Each of these will be paired with a current reproductive rights controversy, such as insurance coverage of contraception, teenagers' access to confidential reproductive health care, abstinence-only sex education and prosecution of pregnant women.  Reproductive justice advocates, including litigators, organizers and legislative advocates will make guest appearances.  The success of this course depends on lively class participation.  Students will write a short piece on each week's topic using a different advocacy style (such as a legislative fact sheet, blog post, initiative ballot argument, op-ed article) and will make oral presentations in class.

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Berkeley). Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. In addition to the regular Monday class, classes will meet for the live negotiations on two Thursday evenings on-campus at 7:00 PM (10\/15 and 10\/22) and three Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM (10\/10, 10\/31 and 11\/14) in the San Francisco office of DLA Piper (555 Mission Street; close to Montgomery St. BART station). Due to the Thursday and Saturday classes, this class will conclude on November 16. The course will be limited by lottery to twelve (12) law students (additional students from business or engineering may also participate). Attention Non-Law Students: You must complete and submit a Non-Law Student Course Add Request Form to the Law School Registrar's Office (Room 100).

Should they be true property rights, with all or most of the powers this implies (creator control over uses, right to compensation from exploitation, etc.), or something else? Would a state-backed reward system work better, so that compensation is divorced from individual control? Should compensation for successful creators be limited or capped, as part of a wider attempt to moderate the distributional impacts of granting individual property rights; or must we tolerate &iquest;big winners&iquest; as an inducement or symbolic reward for other creators? We will address these and related questions by reading two sets of materials: (1) classic treatments of property rights (Locke, Kant, etc.) and social justice (Rawls); and (2) material from the contemporary literature on IP theory.

We shall discuss various notions of betrayal: Political (military) betrayal such as treason, Religious betrayal with Judas as its emblem, but also apostasy (converting one's religion) which is regarded both as a basic human right and also as an act of betrayal, social betrayal - betraying class solidarity as well as Ideological betrayal - betraying a cause. On top of political betrayal we shall deal with personal betrayal, especially in the form of infidelity and in the form of financial betrayal of the kind performed by Madoff. The contrasting notions to betrayal, especially loyalty and trust, will get special consideration so as to shed light or cast shadow, as the case may be, on the idea of betrayal. The seminar will focus not only on the normative aspect of betrayal - moral or legal, but also on the psychological motivations for betraying others. The seminar will revolve around glaring historical examples of betrayal but also use informed fictional novels, plays and movies from Shakespeare and Pinter, to John Le Carre'.nElements used in grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Final Paper.nThis course is cross-listed with PHIL 174L\/274L ETHICSOC 174L\/274L.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Betrayal and Loyalty, Treason and Trust","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2015-2016"},"325":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"522","course_id":213388,"description":"This course will concern itself with the central issues related to private equity investing.

This introductory course will examine the historical precedents and philosophical reasons for treating juveniles differently from adults, and review empirical evidence about child development that can illuminate the reasons for their special status within the court system. Students will learn about the distribution of juvenile delinquency and the impact of significant social and institutional influences on delinquency: family, school, peers, and drugs.  The course will also provide a detailed overview of the juvenile system, from its beginning to the current state of the institution, which will include a review of police work with juveniles, pretrial procedures, and the juvenile court and corrections systems. Major court rulings that have shaped contemporary juvenile justice will be presented. Finally, the course will consider dispositional options available to Courts, and will identify the most effective in reducing delinquency. By the conclusion of this course, students should have an understanding of the juvenile justice system and how it compares with the adult justice system, what programs work to reduce recidivism, and be cognizant of some of the major legal and policy issues confronting that system today.  The course format will combine lecture, group discussions, and guest presentations. Students may also have the opportunity to observe the juvenile justice system first hand by attending a juvenile court session, visiting a correctional facility for adjudicated delinquents, and hearing directly from those who work with high-risk youth on probation or in the community.  Written Work. Each student will write four reflection papers, 5-7 pages each (about 1,700 words) over the quarter. Due dates will be listed in the class syllabus.

We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.

We will examine these topics from a number of substantive and procedural angles using case law, readings, and case studies. We will explore such disparate substantive areas of law as employment discrimination, securities regulation, qui tam actions, and mass torts.

This seminar will address the key dimensions of change in the &quot;big law&quot; market and how changes in the delivery of corporate legal services may affect legal careers, gender equality, diversity, and work-life balance. Topics include the increased power of General Counsel, new organizational models for delivering corporate legal services, the response of  large law firms to new market factors, the expanding role of information technology in the delivery of corporate legal services, third-party litigation financing, changing legal markets outside the US, the evolution of global law firms, the effects of changes in law firm organization on women and lawyers of color, and the effects of changes in the legal market on legal careers. Course materials will include books and journal articles, media reports, blog posts and guest lectures. Students may enroll either in Section 01, Section 02, or Section 03. Students in Section 01 will receive 3 credits and write research papers on a topic of their choice, relying primarily on existing literature (e.g. journal articles, media reports and blog posts). These papers will be due on the regular submission date for Winter Quarter Courses. Students in Section 02 will receive 4 credits and write research papers on a topic of their choice, based on their own empirical research projects.

Topics include intelligence-gathering, investigations, and the prosecution of suspects in U.S. courts, including controversies surrounding the use of informants, material support laws, racial and religious profiling, electronic surveillance, terrorist watchlists, and terrorism trials. In exploring these controversies, the course focuses on several core themes: 1) the contested relationship between rights and security; 2) the question of institutional choice in national security decision-making and oversight; and 3) the challenge of assessing the efficacy of counterterrorism measures. The course pays special attention to the policy controversies that affect U.S. communities, including minority and immigrant communities.  To develop skills central to the work of practicing lawyers, students will write two short papers that simulate the actual work assignments of lawyers for government agencies, human rights groups, or other interested parties. For instance, students might draft a local ordinance on police intelligence-gathering, prepare a memo for a national security agency head or member of Congress, or design an administrative mechanism for resolving watchlist complaints. These assignments, for Professional Writing (PW) credit, will be due before the end of the quarter. Alternatively, students may opt to take the seminar for Research (R) credit with the professor's approval, according to the standard requirements and deadlines.

Using a broad mix of case law, case studies, and scholarly analysis, this seminar will interrogate those attacks--including their historical roots, their theoretical justifications, and their practical effects.  We will first study &quot;replacement reforms&quot;--attempts to jettison the common law in favor of alternative compensation mechanisms, including workers' compensation, auto no-fault, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, housed within the U.S. Court of Claims.  Second, we will study modern tort reform initiatives, often dubbed &quot;discouragement reforms,&quot; which have chiseled away at damages and chilled personal injury victims' incentives and capacity to seek relief.  Finally, we will study the United States Supreme Court's own tort reform activity, including recent jurisprudence limiting punitive damages, preferencing arbitration, and granting broad preemptive effect to agency actions. Through this analysis, students will develop a deeper and richer understanding of the tort system, its contemporary operation and excesses, and the uneasy but undeniably important place tort law--and civil litigation more generally--occupies in contemporary American society.

It is an area that combines elements of treaty and customary international law, public policy, and private dispute resolution. In the past decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties and other agreements with investment-related provisions, followed by a sharp rise in the number of disputes between private investors and sovereign states under those specialized legal regimes. The rise of international investment law and arbitration has generated a new and exciting practice area in global law firms, where teams of lawyers act on behalf of investors against sovereign states, or defending sovereign states against investor claims, before international arbitral tribunals. This course will cover four broad areas: (I) the historic, theoretical and policy grounds underpinning international investment law; (II) the substantive obligations and standards governing the investor-state relationship; (III) the growth of investor-state arbitration and its impact on international law; and (IV) the wider issues of fairness and functionality of investment treaty law and investor-state dispute resolution. The course uses materials from international investment treaty texts, case law, and commentaries to enable students to evaluate and apply legal doctrine to future situations. The course will highlight different and sometimes conflicting interpretations and decisions in the area, and invite students to analyze, discuss, and form their own views on key issues.  Students may choose between a series of weekly response papers, or a larger research paper, and will serve as discussion facilitators along with the instructor.

The course emphasizes the cooperative and competing roles that the federal and state governments play in implementing environmental law in the United States. The course encourages students to adopt a comparative and dynamic view of environmental protection under U.S. law.  We begin with a discussion of the property law roots of environmental law. Next we briefly touch on some aspects of U.S. administrative law that are essential to understanding the material that follows (students should feel free to take this class without having taken Administrative Law). This is followed by a discussion of the risk assessment and cost-benefit frameworks essential to understanding the current U.S. approach to environmental problems. We conclude this segment with a comparison of two approaches to chemical safety regulation - the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act and the EU REACH directive.  Next, we focus on three key substantive federal environmental statutes: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Next, we turn to the National Environmental Policy Act to understand how environmental concerns are included in the process of making agency decisions. The course concludes with a discussion of current EPA efforts to address emissions of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Professor Larry Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, but many of the Law School's esteemed group of Supreme Court litigators will be participating in one or more of the sessions.nnThe 18 students in the seminar will be divided into two courts.  One of these courts will sit five times and the other will sit four times. During each sitting, the court will hear arguments in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix between criminal and civil cases. Each student will be assigned the role of a particular Justice for the entire quarter.  Each student's task while sitting on cases is to do his or her best to understand that particular justice, based on that justice's  prior opinions and judicial philosophy.  In this sense, the seminar is intended to help promote insight into the role of judicial personality and philosophy within the decisional process. The weekly seminars will proceed as follows: In preparation for each week's session, all students (whether they are the two students arguing that week, the nine students judging that week, or the seven students observing that week) will read the lower courts' decisions, the briefs (the party briefs and selected amicus briefs) and the major precedents implicated. During the first portion of each week's session (approximately one hour), two of the students (who are members of the Court that is not sitting that week) will present oral arguments to the nine &quot;justices&quot; sitting that week. The arguments will be based on the briefs that were actually filed in the case. During the second segment of each week's session (approximately 45 minutes), the &quot;justices&quot; who are sitting that week will &quot;conference&quot; the case while the other non-sitting students, students who argued,instructors and guests will observe.  Again, each student will be in the role of a particular justice.  At the end of the &quot;conference,&quot; the opinion-writing will be assigned to one &quot;justice&quot; in the majority and one &quot;justice&quot; in the dissent. During the final portion of each session (approximately one hour), theinstructors, guests and students will engage in a broad discussion of what they just observed.  This may include analysis of the briefing, discussion about the oral argument, reflections on the &quot;conference,&quot; and, more generally, a discussion about the case and its significance. After each class, the student assigned to draft the majority opinion will have two weeks to circulate a draft to the &quot;Court.&quot;  The student writing the dissent will then have two weeks to circulate his or her opinion. The other sitting &quot;justices&quot; can join one of these opinions, request some changes as a condition of joining, or decide to write separately. Over the course of the Quarter, then, each student will argue one case, sit on four or five cases, and draft at least one opinion.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":7,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"W","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"writing","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Supreme Court Simulation Seminar","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"378":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"608","course_id":127084,"description":"(Same as IPER 335, OIT 338.)

Topics include: taking and defending depositions, motion practice, trial evidence, including admission of trial exhibits in evidence and use of prior witness statements to refresh and impeach a witness, jury selection and voir dire, opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses, and closing arguments. Students will try a full jury case through to verdict with use of jurors and usually before a real judge in the courthouse in Palo Alto at the end of the course. Students will also have a chance to watch the jurors deliberate and talk with them after their verdict. The course takes place during seven weeks of the Autumn Quarter with two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 (these usually occur on T, W, or Th, plus an occasional M), plus two Saturday workshops and the final weekend of jury trials, Saturday and Sunday November 14 and 15. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end before 9:00. For a detailed schedule, contact Stephanie Basso at sbasso@law.stanford.edu. The format for each topic begins with a lecture\/discussion featuring video vignettes of various techniques and a live demonstration by an expert trial lawyer. Following the discussion portion of each topic are small group sessions during which each student practices the skills involved. Constructive feedback is given after each exercise by two of our faculty of very experienced Bay Area litigators and judges. Most exercises are also videoed for further one-on-one critique by another faculty member. The central philosophy of the workshop is that skills are best acquired in an experiential manner by seeing and doing. Frequent short, well-defined exercises followed by immediate constructive feedback in a non-competitive, non-threatening atmosphere provide the core of the program. The workshop directors are Tim Hallahan, Judge Sallie Kim and Jeff Kobrick. Tim has taught similar programs at Harvard Law School, the University of San Francisco School of Law, Boalt Hall, the California Continuing Education of the Bar, and in private and public interest law firms around the country. Sallie is a United States Magistrate Judge in San Francisco and was a partner in a civil litigation firm and also previously taught a class at SLS and served as Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Jeff is a partner in a civil litigation firm and has taught litigation skills courses at Harvard and Stanford Law Schools for a number of years. Special Instructions: If you haven't taken Evidence you must contact Tim Hallahan before the course begins for some brief pre-course reading assignments. There are no papers or tests, but attendance at every session is required. Since we will begin our trial advocacy exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Mandatory attendance.

Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation and Option 1 (section 01) a series of short essays and a short research paper; or Option 2 (section 02) a long research paper involving independent research. Students electing option 2 (section 02) will be graded on the H\/P\/R\/F system and will receive Research (R) credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Negotiation Seminar (LAW 615) strongly preferred but not required.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments and final paper.

You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your secretary, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory, you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system. The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required. Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Once you commit to the class, you must complete it or receive a failing grade. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Petitions of this type must be extraordinarily strong in order to be granted.

The course will consider these topics as they have played out in current cases, including social impact litigation, mass product defect claims, financial litigation including securities class actions, patent and copyright disputes, gender, race, and other discrimination claims, assisted by guest lectures by judges and lawyers. Early in the quarter each student will choose a recent or ongoing complex litigation to investigate. (A list of candidate litigations will be provided, but students are free to choose any complex litigation that interests them.) During the quarter, students will conduct research on the litigation including, where possible, contacting key participants for information and perspective. This research will serve as the basis for in-class discussion, focusing on different aspects of the litigation as the quarter progresses. Students will hand in 2 brief papers on the litigation they are researching during the course of the quarter, for review and comment, but not for grading, and a final paper including the two previous drafts plus additional analysis by the official Fall quarter paper deadline.

Readings will include law review articles, legal pleadings and case studies that allow analysis and exploration of the tensions and challenges that exist within the legal system for public interest practitioners.

Students formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and advocate before the court at evidentiary motions or preliminary hearings.  The cases, almost always felonies, include drug offenses, thefts, burglaries, assaults (including domestic assaults), weapons possessions, and a range of less common crimes.  Students offer testimony by police officers, crime victims, and other witnesses and cross-examine defense witnesses, including those defendants who take the stand.  Clinic students spend at least three full days a week at the D.A.'s office.  All six students must spend all day Tuesdays and Thursdays on site.  Each student also must choose a third on-site day that stays constant through the term.  There generally will be two class sessions each week-a three-hour on-campus class and a lunchtime seminar in the D.A.'s office.  At the beginning of the term classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument.  Toward the end of the term the focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice.  Topics include the impact of race, gender, and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers.  Students typically tour the Santa Clara County crime lab, San Quentin Prison, and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system.  Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings.  During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor.  Evidence is a prerequisite.  In rare cases a concurrent clinic module in evidence can fulfill this requirement.  Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged.  Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework.  Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy.  Class attendance is mandatory.  Grading is on the H\/P system.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses:  All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered on a full-time basis for twelve credits.  This format allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams, and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other class, seminar, directed research, or other credit-yielding activity within the Law School or University during their clinical quarter.  Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a class regularly.  There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register.  These exceptions are approved case by case.  The clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period.  Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from on-site and faculty supervisors.  Students are expected to be available by email or cell phone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work.  In some weeks casework may demand longer hours.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected by a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not drop the course later except in limited and exceptional cases.  Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school career.  For more general information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":2,"max_units_repeat":8,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"}],"class_id":15341,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":6,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 7, 2016","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"George","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Fisher","middle_name":"","name":"Fisher, G.","sunet_id":"fisherg"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 4, 2016","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"professionalskills","organization":"LAW"},{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Criminal Prosecution Clinic: Clinical Practice","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2015-2016"},"389":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"620B","course_id":209583,"description":"The six students enrolled in Stanford's Criminal Prosecution Clinic prosecute cases at the San Jose Superior Court under the guidance of Santa Clara County prosecutors.

Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a class regularly.  There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register.  These exceptions are approved case by case.  The clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period.  Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from on-site and faculty supervisors.  Students are expected to be available by email or cell phone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work.  In some weeks casework may demand longer hours.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected by a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not drop the course later except in limited and exceptional cases.  Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school career.

Students formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and advocate before the court at evidentiary motions or preliminary hearings.  The cases, almost always felonies, include drug offenses, thefts, burglaries, assaults (including domestic assaults), weapons possessions, and a range of less common crimes.  Students offer testimony by police officers, crime victims, and other witnesses and cross-examine defense witnesses, including those defendants who take the stand.  Clinic students spend at least three full days a week at the D.A.'s office.  All six students must spend all day Tuesdays and Thursdays on site.  Each student also must choose a third on-site day that stays constant through the term.  There generally will be two class sessions each week-a three-hour on-campus class and a lunchtime seminar in the D.A.'s office.  At the beginning of the term classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument.  Toward the end of the term the focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice.  Topics include the impact of race, gender, and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers.  Students typically tour the Santa Clara County crime lab, San Quentin Prison, and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system.  Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings.  During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor.  Evidence is a prerequisite.  In rare cases a concurrent clinic module in evidence can fulfill this requirement.  Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged.  Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework.  Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy.  Class attendance is mandatory.  Grading is on the H\/P system.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses:  All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered on a full-time basis for twelve credits.

Sentencing is the process by which criminal sanctions are imposed in individual cases following criminal convictions. Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable. The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore sentencing theories and their application, the nature, scope and function of corrections, the impact of mass incarceration on crime and communities, the effectiveness of rehabilitation, the relationship between sanctions and crime, and the consequences of prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates. Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. We also plan to visit a correctional facility. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation, and either: (1) three reflection papers of 5 to 7 pages each, or (2) a longer research paper. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02) which meets the research (R) requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.

Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.

You will then learn how legislative coalitions are built and broken, how and why bargaining occurs, the roles of interest groups and lobbyists, how an Executive Branch tries to influence Congress, how political parties and elections influence legislative behavior, and how the press and personalities influence all of the above. While this is primarily a class about policymaking process, we will learn enough about federal budget policy to make your participation in budget legislative simulations more effective.

Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation.

Becoming a trusted advisor or effective advocate is essentially an interpersonal process that relies upon social and emotional skills, such as listening in ways that gain client trust and engagement or delivering tough messages in ways that reduce defensiveness and increase mutual problem solving.  These skills can be learned.  Unlike conceptual knowledge, they are acquired through practicing new behaviors that expand skills or undo old habits.  Adult learning is strengthened through experiencing the concept in action, reflecting upon the experience and practicing it.  I will construct such exercises for use in class as well as in workgroups outside of class. This course will introduce students to simple frameworks that raise awareness and understanding of social intelligence and expose them to a process of learning they can employ in their everyday interactions for continued growth and development.nSpecial Instructions:  This course develops student skills and not simply conceptual knowledge.  Learning will come from consistent class attendance and a willingness to participate actively - not only in occasional role plays but primarily as one's self, practicing new behaviors that build skill sets.  Written assignments will be brief weekly reflections on personal learning.  Since I will establish workgroups following the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking this course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be made at the conclusion of the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter as learning will depend upon intact workgroups throughout the quarter.

Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend four or five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.

In addition to the text itself, we will consult historical materials from the drafting and ratification of the parts under consideration each week.

In the context of both real and simulated case studies, we will address diverse public policy issues, both domestic (including civil rights, racial justice, economic inequality and natural resources management) and international (negotiating bilateral and multilateral agreements, including global security environmental treaties). The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a substantial group paper and presentation analyzing a selected case (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue) and the team's internal negotiation process. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 615) or its substantial equivalent. Advanced degree students (and graduate students in other departments and programs) are encouraged to enroll provided that they have previous negotiation training or equivalent practice experience. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students approved for &quot;R&quot; credit will be graded on the H\/P\/R\/F system. Elements used in grading: Class participation and engagement, including simulations; attendance; preparation for and contributions to discussion; short written assignments; final project involving group and individual components.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mixed H\/P\/R\/F or MP\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"}],"class_id":1048,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":24,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.","schedules":[{"days":["Monday"],"end_date":"Mar 7, 2016","end_time":"7:15:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Janet","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Martinez","middle_name":"","name":"Martinez, J.","sunet_id":"janetkgm"}],"location":"LAW 320D","start_date":"Jan 4, 2016","start_time":"4:15:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Winter","units":"3"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"R -Research Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"RESEARCH"}],"class_id":1049,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":2,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.

In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, farm animals, animals in entertainment, and federal issues regarding animals.  The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to animals in new ways.  Students have called it a great bar review class, because concepts from many areas of law are covered with respect to their application to animals and their interests.  More and more firms, large and small, are providing pro bono (and paying) work in the animal law area, as the field gains momentum and reputability in the legal community.  Mr. Wagman is a partner at Schiff Hardin in San Francisco, with a full-time animal law practice, representing organizations and individuals in a wide range of cases.  He is one of the authors of the Animal Law casebook, and has been practicing animal law for most of his 23-year career.  His practice includes litigation, consultation, legislative work, and extensive writing and lecturing on various animal law topics.  The class includes regular updates on his current cases, as well as real-life experiences from the front lines of the animal law frontier.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various tactical, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach focuses on the following questions: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? Among the conceptual issues we will examine include the problem of spoilers who seek to sabotage agreements, the role of mediators, the role international legal rules can play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, and the advantages and disadvantages of unilateral versus and reciprocal measures in advancing conflict resolution efforts. Particular conflicts we will explore include the Northern Ireland conflict, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the U.S.-Soviet Cold War rivalry.nnSpecial Instructions: Total enrollment in this course will be limited to 20.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.  Special Instructions: - - General Structure of Clinical Courses.  The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation, written assignments.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.  Special Instructions: - - General Structure of Clinical Courses.  The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Simulations will include critical-path material supply agreements, cross-cultural joint ventures, airline reorganizations, big pharma workouts and big oil exploration negotiations. The goals of the class include: (1) acquisition of new theoretical bases beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar, in order to better inform analysis in preparation for negotiations, and (2) to expanding skills through deeper examination of scenarios and far more challenging simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, a series of short papers and in-class presentation.

All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with community groups in advocating for the provision of better and more equitable educational opportunities to their children. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education.  Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational finance reform litigation.  Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaboration with Consortium for Public Research and Leadership (CPRL).  Through the CPRL, students will work with Stanford Graduate School of Education and Graduate School of Business students to pursue research and consulting for clients on topics such as accountability, community outreach, and school climate.

Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. - - Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. - - The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. - - Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career. - - The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. - - For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. - - Cross listed with the School of Education. - - Elements used in grading: Projects and class participation.

The course has a special focus on conflict and dispute resolution processes that take place in contexts where governing laws may be ambiguous, contested, or unenforceable. The goal is to help students learn how to critically evaluate and prepare to participate in these kinds of processes, with special attention to what their role as lawyers or legal advisors can be. Through simulations and case studies, the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes. These processes include track 2 processes, governance\/civil society engagement (particularly regarding resource management, transparency and accountability, extractive industries), transitional justice (including reparations, truth-telling, reconciliation efforts, victim-perpetrator dialogue, restorative justice), peace treaty development, and DDR (disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of armed groups).  Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar (LAW 615), its substantial academic equivalent, or substantial experience in the field. SPILS students are especially encouraged to enroll. This course is also open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs including International Policy Studies, provided that they have had sufficient prior background in negotiation. Please describe prior negotiations coursework and experience on your Consent Form. Any student deemed to be lacking the required foundational knowledge may still be admitted to the course, but required to attend an intensive bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods prior to the first Wednesday Advanced Seminar session.  Grading Criteria: The seminar requires that students do the required reading, actively participate in class and simulations, make a team presentation analyzing a case study in international negotiation process, and to submit occasional short writing assignments.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mandatory P\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"}],"class_id":46116,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":20,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree.","schedules":[{"days":["Thursday"],"end_date":"May 27, 2016","end_time":"8:30:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Brenna","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Powell","middle_name":"","name":"Powell, B.","sunet_id":"brenna"},{"first_name":"Janet","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Martinez","middle_name":"","name":"Martinez, J.","sunet_id":"janetkgm"},{"first_name":"Megan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Karsh","middle_name":"A","name":"Karsh, M.","sunet_id":"mkarsh"}],"location":"LAW 320D","start_date":"Mar 28, 2016","start_time":"5:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2015-2016 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Advanced Negotiation: International","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"430":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PS -Professional Skills Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFSKILLS"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"}],"code":"662","course_id":209618,"description":"The Youth and Education Advocacy Advanced Clinic provides an opportunity for students who have already successfully completed the Education Advocacy Clinic to continue their advocacy work in the Clinic and\/or to pursue a discrete project related to educational equity advocacy.

This class seeks to explore both the current trends and the future possibilities of this transformation, as we begin to train the future generation of technology savvy lawyers, and technologists who understand the intricacies and potential of what the law could be.  Legal informatics could be defined as a computational perspective of law:  where does legal information reside, how is it manipulated, and which algorithms and data structures are used in various legal functions?  Note that there are no prerequisites for this class beyond an interest in the subject. There are numerous examples of technologically driven legal transformation. Case law search has moved from hard copy to closed digital systems such as Westlaw and LexisNexis, and into free cloud-based systems such as Google Scholar and Wikipedia.  More and more statutes are available online.  Changes can be seen in e-discovery, privacy, the delivery of (online) legal services, and the budding legal technology startup community.  As a result, questions arise as to the proper statutory and ethical boundaries between humans and machines in implementing legal activities. Beyond the current and near-term technologies, however, are core academic and philosophical questions that will have increasing import as machines gain in sophistication and capability. For example, although the law differentiates between the responsibility assignable to minors compared to adults, we are far from identifying the point at which an agent or robot is morally responsible for its own actions, as opposed to the responsibility being assigned to its creator.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Legal Technology and Informatics","units_max":3,"units_min":2,"year":"2015-2016"},"435":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"669","course_id":213335,"description":"A lawyer who communicates not only in a cerebrally persuasive way, but also in an emotionally gripping way, has an enormous strategic advantage.  Judges, jurors, and clients are all human beings, susceptible to compelling stories like everyone else. This course - conducted by a television and film writer who is also a lawyer with experience in all three branches of government, private practice, political campaigns, and a labor union - teaches how to compose an engaging story and how to apply those skills to a variety of legal situations.  The first part of the course will cover the art of storytelling on both a theoretical and a practical track.  On the theoretical track, students will study story drive; narrative structure; beginnings, middles, and ends; openings; plot and character; exposition; and transitions. The class will have a healthy amount of assigned reading and viewing that illustrate each of these components in literature, drama, and film. On the practical track, students will undertake writing exercises that parallel the theoretical discussion, to develop a first-hand facility with those facets of storytelling.  In the second part of the course, students will apply their storytelling insights and skills to specific legal situations: A criminal case. An appellate case. A legislative proposal. A labor negotiation. A public relations crisis. Students will discuss in depth their narrative approaches to these situations, along with those taken by lawyers in other cases in the respective areas. By the end of the course students will have a powerful tool few of their peers will possess, and be able to approach their day-to-day professional challenges in a more effective and confident way.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Narrative Skills and the Law","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"436":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"670","course_id":209711,"description":"This course explores the law of economic and political crimes associated with the rubric &quot;white collar crime.&quot; The class is divided thematically between mens rea issues and substantive issues.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them. As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals. At the start of each session (starting with the second session) there will be a brief quiz on the material that was covered in the readings and discussion of the prior session.

This course is offered to &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; so that you will not be at a disadvantage in other courses at the Law School that draw on economic ideas (or, just as importantly, not be at a disadvantage when you graduate and you encounter economic ideas and arguments on the job or in life.)So, what is economics, exactly?  All societies face the problem of scarcity - there are not enough resources to satisfy people's desires for all things. Economics studies how individuals and societies deal with scarcity and the mechanisms for deciding what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets the output.  It is as simple and complex as that!  As you can imagine, the practical applications are nearly endless. Please note that the course focus will be microeconomics - the branch of economics that focuses on the economic behavior of individual decision-making units, such as households and firms, and how these individual decisions fit together.  (I will not discuss macroeconomics in this course - i.e. the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly inflation, unemployment, and business cycles.) More specifically, I will spend the vast majority of the course taking you through the basic supply and demand model of markets - what it is, where it came from, how and when it works, and when it does not work so well.  With that base, I can branch out accordingly to help you apply it to a wide variety of relevant issues. Though I will not focus specifically on how economic ideas have been used in a legal context (there is another course and seminar that does that), I will make some effort to link the economic ideas we discuss directly to legal topics. COURSE PROCEDURE: My primary goal is to teach you the fundamental principles of microeconomics by (1) providing you the relevant schema to understand the basic tools of economic analysis; and by (2) drilling you extensively with problems, cases, current events, and other applied materials so as to help you develop the ability to use these tools and truly make them your own. A heavy emphasis will be placed on building a conceptual understanding of some key economic models, looking closely at the underlying assumptions of those models, and engaging in the process of questioning and relaxing those assumptions in the context of actual &quot;real life&quot; issues. Please do not mistake the analytical rigor I will require, to mean that we will use sophisticated mathematics.  To the contrary, I believe that most powerful economic principles should be highly intuitive and non-quantitative.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Introduction to Microeconomics","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"446":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"679","course_id":213992,"description":"We will seek to determine a useful meaning of the notion of the rule of law to identify some measurement of adherence and to explore the importance of the rule of law in terms of economic, socio-political and human development.

With some exceptions, that system is characterized by relatively stable political and legal institutions, low levels of explicit corruption, high bureaucratic capacity in public organizations, and relatively open, impersonal access to political, policymaking, and legal institutions. Although these characteristics are now often taken for granted, the process through which they emerged remains remarkably opaque. In the 1780s under the Articles of Confederation, the United States was a poor developing country on the fringe of the Atlantic community with limited capacity and a striking inability to provide basic public goods, such as security. One hundred years later, it well along the way to becoming the richest nation in the world. How did this transformation occur? Drawing on judicial opinions, legal scholarship, political science, economics, and history, this course explores how institutions evolved to create such a system. It traces the problem of institutional development through several critical periods in the history of American public law, including the emergence of the Constitution, the events leading up to and following the Civil War, the Progressive era, World War II, institutional changes occurring roughly during 1964-75, and the emergence of the modern administrative state. Although the primarily focus is on the American experience, we place these developments in comparative context as well.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Pivotal Moments in American Institutions and Public Law, 1791-Present","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2015-2016"},"448":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"681A","course_id":214039,"description":"This discussion group will explore how recent insights from psychology and related fields can help make us better students, better professionals, better leaders, and better people.

The first general question is whether philosophical inquiries on big issues - e.g. what it means to be well-off; what obligations do we have to strangers who are radically worse off than we are; when should we observe rights-based limits on our pursuit of aggregate welfare; what does it mean to coerce another party - help us make choices when it is not obvious what we should do. The second, related question is whether empirical knowledge - e.g. psychological, economic - might help us, in addition, instead, or no more than philosophical insight. The specific questions we will focus on have little in common, other than that they are not easily answered. Some refer to decisions that seem wholly self-regarding, others that seem to refer to obligations to others. Some involve acting in professional role, some out of role. Some seem plainly important, others might seem more trivial. And it is possible, of course, that you will come to believe that philosophers or empiricists may have more to say about some of the issues that we discuss than others.  The five questions I tentatively plan on exploring are: (a) how a late adolescent patient (or a doctor advising that patient) ought to choose between an operation that will significantly improve various aspects of her life over the next thirty years but poses a substantial risk of leaving her wheelchair-dependent in middle age and an operation that will lead to impaired functioning for the next few decades but mobile without mechanical aids past the age of 50 (b) how we can evaluate claims that virtually all of us living in economically prosperous countries are obliged to give away a substantial chunk of our income to save the lives of very poor people around the world (c) how we should evaluate the propriety of torture designed to elicit information about planned criminal\/terrorist activities that might arguably save those who would be harmed if the plans came to fruition (d) how an attorney in a big law firm ought to determine when and whether it is appropriate to ask an administrative assistant to do work that is not directly related to the production of legal services (e.g. pick up laundry from the cleaners) and whether (and if so, why) the answer to that question is sensitive to the gender of the attorney and the attorney's administrative assistant, and finally, (e) whether existing rules governing the conduct of war that draw significant distinctions between killing soldiers and killing civilians and between killing civilians intentionally rather than knowingly are sensible.

For example, many arguments about politics or policy involve highly complex factual assumptions and predictions. Despite the difficulty of assessing the validity of factual assumptions and forecasting the consequences of any particular decision, many people maintain great confidence in the correctness of their beliefs. Why is that?  In addition, some people are very successful in influencing other people with respect to such beliefs or opinions.  How do they do that, and what makes their audience susceptible to being convinced? In the extreme, what allows this sort of person to be a leader or at least a &quot;thought leader&quot; (to use what regrettably seems to be a new entry into our lexicon)?  In this discussion group, we will read books that engage these questions in diverse ways.  Students that join the group will be expected to be full participants in the discussion.  Neither of us is an expert in the topic and neither of us expects to have any more to say than you will. So please join us only if you find this format appealing.  Another requirement of the group will be to create a written log, or summary, of what we read and discuss.  We will all share responsibility for writing this.

In client counseling and transactional representation, we are charged with helping our clients avoid failure. And as professionals, we are enjoined to avoid failures ourselves. So we spend our careers in and around failure - anticipating it, reconstructing it, and seeking to prevent and remedy it. This seminar explores the human experience of failure in both legal and non-legal settings. What are the circumstances (structural and cognitive) that appear to lead to personal, professional, legal, political, and moral failures? How does the law shape social understandings of what failure is? What kinds of failures appear to support the belief that failure is (almost always) avoidable, and thus the fault of individuals who experience failure? Why do other failures seem inevitable? What is the narrative structure and allure of representations of failure as a condition of success? How are failure and the harms that flow from the experience of failure remembered or forgotten by individuals and groups who cause failure and those who attempt to redress it? Sources for the seminar will range from cases dealing with professional malpractice and cultural histories of professional ideology to poetry, constitutional history, theories of creative destruction, and responses to mass atrocities.

In five two-hour sessions at Professor McConnell's home, we will cover (1) Jesus's arrest in the the Garden of Gethsemane, (2) his trial before Jewish authorities, (3) his trial before Roman authorities, and (4) his execution, with (5) one session left for general considerations. (We will not delve into the reports of his resurrection.) We will focus on the nature of the charges against Jesus, the legal procedures employed, the evidence and the defense, the relation between imperial and local authorities, the relation between religious and secular law, the ethical roles of the individuals involved, and the mode of execution. Our primary text will be Raymond E. Brown, The Death of the Messiah (Yale University Press 2004), a scholarly two-volume study drawing on all the extant historical sources.  Among the questions we are likely to discuss are: Was the trial fair by the standards of the day? Was Jesus guilty of any of the charges? What were the authorities - and particularly Pilate - trying to accomplish? What was the role of the mob? Was Roman law a constraining influence, or the opposite? What was Jesus's own perspective on the proceedings? How reliable and\/or plausible are the sources?  Although this subject is of religious and spiritual concern to some, including (in all likelihood) some students taking the seminar, the seminar will not consider the material in a religious way, but instead as a legal event. The instructor hopes that the class will be religiously diverse, and especially encourages non-Christian students to enroll. Discussion will, of course, be conducted in a way that is comfortable for persons of all shades of belief and disbelief.  Begin in Winter Quarter and run through Spring Quarter.

Moreover, our legal system frequently compensates people who are injured (and therefore must ascertain if, and how badly, they are injured.)What we get the chance to investigate and discuss in this discussion group is what we mean when we say that people are injured by some particular practices or outcomes that might seem, without much reflection, to be obviously injurious. More particularly, we will discuss five issues: (1) In our first session, we will work out the implications of an academic literature that seems to explore what I see to be one of the finest of one-line jokes (&quot;Nothing matters, and what if it did?&quot;). The literature on hedonic adaptation might seem to suggest that we can neither injure others nor improve their lots: very quickly, people return to a (generally mildly positive) fixed equilibrium state even when seemingly very good or very bad things happen to them. We will explore the literature and its limits. (2) In the final four sessions, we will explore four conditions or practices that seem intuitively injurious and problematic and try to figure out more precisely what might be bad about them, or whether they are actually injurious in the ways that we might at first think: we will explore what is injurious about poverty, discrimination, sexual harassment, and even the big one, death.

A small but growing subset of impact investments involves social impact bonds to help finance government pay-for-success contracts with organizations seeking to problems such as recidivism, homelessness, and asthma.  Foundations, including Gates, Ford, and MacArthur make such impact investments through what the Internal Revenue Code terms &quot;program-related investments,&quot; which count toward the foundations' required annual payout. And some family offices and high net worth individuals make them out of their checkbooks.  We will take a sympathetic but skeptical look at a range of impact investments to understand their potential for solving social problems and also their limitations. Two pervasive questions will be the scope of investment opportunities that sacrifice financial return, and whether and when investments that seek risk-adjusted financial returns accomplish anything that ordinary commercial investments wouldn't do anyway.

In some cases, individuals research on their own; at other times, they work within a range of organizations, such as business entities, universities or other nonprofits.  The products of research have powerful effects: they alter human understanding-how we see ourselves and the world; they influence government, policies, and markets; they also shape lifestyles, diets, education, and medical care.  In addition, research findings may bring adulation and wealth to the researchers who produce them.  Unethical research processes and false research findings (&quot;bad research&quot;) can be extremely damaging.  They may set science, medicine, business, and social policy in the wrong direction; they invariably waste money; and, directly or indirectly, they are likely to harm the very people they promise to benefit.  Bad research is sometimes the result of intentional wrongdoing, but it may also stem from carelessness, &quot;honest&quot; mistakes, and unconscious biases.  Through a selection of intriguing case studies and other accounts, this discussion group will explore instances in which research has taken a wrong turn, or is perceived to have done so.  What are the consequences for society?  What are the consequences for the researchers and their subjects?  What ethical, legal and policy questions arise?

In this seminar, we will take stock of key global developments that underlie such a transformation, and analyze their impact on the future of human rights, as follows: nn1. The rise of emerging powers (such as Brazil, China and India) and the relative decline of Europe and the U.S. point to a multipolar world order. Together with the proliferation of international regulations (such as transnational corporations' codes of conduct, legal standards advanced by coalitions of NGOs, and decisions of international bodies such as the WTO and UN agencies), this trend results in a legal and political arena that is both broader and more fragmented. In this new context, states and NGOs in the Global North no longer control the creation and implementation of human rights standards, while new actors (from transnational social movements to Global South states and NGOs) emerge as influential voices.  nn2. Information and communication technologies present new challenges and opportunities for human rights. As the mobilizations catalyzed by the Arab Spring have shown, tools such as social networks, video documentaries, digital reporting, online learning and long-distance education can accelerate political change, reduce the informational disadvantages suffered by marginalized groups, and bring together national, regional and global groups capable of making a direct impact on the protection of rights. nn3. The range of actors and legal and political strategies has been considerably expanded. Time-honored strategies such as naming and shaming recalcitrant states are being complemented with newer strategies for transnational research, information circulation, and training, which involve a host of different actors, including social movements, online media outlets, inter-governmental organizations, universities and virtual activist networks.nnThe seminar will be divided into three sections, each dealing with one of these transformations. Each section, in turn, will be divided into two discussion sessions and one lecture by a leading scholar and\/or practitioner.nnThe seminar will revolve around the discussion of the assigned readings and materials, as well as presentations by students and guest speakers. Grades will be based on an in-class presentation and a final paper.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAW","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversityabove200","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"The Future of Human Rights: Law, Politics, and Social Justice in a Multipolar, Multimedia World","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2015-2016"},"472":{"academic_career":"LAW","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"684","course_id":214082,"description":"This course looks at conflicts of interest and ethical issues as they arise within academic work.

In early 21st century, the main socialist countries have disappeared and globalization has produced a pronounced convergence between common law and civil law. We also became aware that comparative law has to compare more than law and has to include the social and political context of the law. The comparative method is important, but the substance to be compared has changed.  This course introduces students to the main historical experiences of law using the comparative method and law and society materials. They will find a new way of looking at Roman, medieval, or 19th century law because its &quot;monuments&quot; are placed in social perspective. The method will be used to reconstruct the contemporary ideas of human rights and rule of law in the context of specific countries.  Students will have two writing obligations: (1) brief reflective essays on assigned readings and (2) a research paper. Starting in session 2, students will prepare brief reflective essays on the required reading (or readings) for the session and submit them to the professors and other students 24 hours prior to the beginning of the session. Assigned readings will all be in English. Additional readings may be in other languages. For the research paper the student will, with professorial approval, choose a country and a topic and discuss the work in progress with the professors at least twice during the quarter. It should not exceed 5.000 words.

This course covers the development of alternative dispute resolution in the U.S., with an emphasis on arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). It describes how the federal and state governments have gradually come to accept and now favor the private settlement of commercial disputes based on consent of parties. It examines the many different contexts and industries in which arbitration is conducted, including government-mandated programs for labor disputes, systems established by specific industries such as the diamond trade and professional sports associations, the construction industry, and commercial disputes in general; more controversial is the use of arbitration for consumer, class action and employment disputes. This historic reversal of power over adjudication from government to the private sector has alleviated the delays and uncertainties of judicial litigation, and has created a huge and growing legal field of attorneys, arbitrators, and service providers fashioning and administering systems ranging in complexity from the most formal mega dispute with full discovery to the resolution of mini disputes through mechanically applied algorithms. Allowing private parties to agree on the law and procedures that govern their disputes has led, moreover, to numerous clashes of interests, including evasion of public policies established by legislation. How to deal with alleged violations of public policy, errors of law, erroneous findings of fact, unfair procedures, unequal negotiating power, and arbitrator bias are among the continuing and complex difficulties currently faced by courts and legislatures. The US Supreme Court's recent attempts to deal with several aspects of these difficulties will be considered. We will also examine the less heralded but highly significant use of mediation as a relatively speedy and inexpensive method for private dispute resolution, and the recent development of hybrid systems and other innovations.

Program in Corporate Governance &amp; Practice. The course, designed to be taken in conjunction with Corporations in the fall, takes an economic approach to the analysis of corporate law. In particular, we ask why American corporation law has its particular structure. We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties and shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of a variety of real-life incidents, including the collapse of Enron and the 2008 financial crisis. No knowledge of economics is presupposed, so the course will also introduce basic economics and finance concepts necessary to understand these concepts. Some course sessions, largely in the Winter, will feature outside speakers who will complement the discussions with real-world examples drawn from practice.  Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. Students may be also asked to prepare brief presentations to help guide discussions. Students will be required to submit reflection papers (2 to 3 pages in length) that evaluate, critique, and discuss some or all of the key topics reviewed in the previous week's session.

The colloquium meets in all three quarters. During the autumn quarter, students will engage in group policy discussions. During the winter quarter, a leading expert in the field - a faculty member, a lawyer, a public official, a member of an advocacy groups, or an entrepreneur - will present his or her research, a paper, or his or her experiences to the class on a specific topic. Following these presentations, all students will participate with the lecturer in a class discussion based on assigned readings, the presentation, and students' own experience in the area. During the spring quarter, the students will present their research papers focused on the solution of an environmental or energy issue.  Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. During the first quarter, students will work in teams and will have to submit memos in preparation for the policy discussion. During the second quarter, students will individually write weekly commentary papers to be submitted before the lecture evaluating, critiquing, and\/or discussing key issues from the assigned reading(s). In the third quarter, students are expected to present their papers and comment on the other students' research.

Usually the term applies to analyses of quantitative data and the researcher relies on data collected by others. But the term &quot;empirical&quot; properly encompasses both qualitative and quantitative data, including interviews, legal documents, survey research and experimental results. Analysts interested in using such data need to understand how they were collected, in order to decide what data can appropriately be used to answer different kinds of questions. Often to answer the questions of interest, a researcher needs to collect new data, which poses challenging questions about how to design an empirical research study. Answering these questions appropriately is important to ensure publication in a peer-reviewed journal, which is becoming increasingly important to legal academia. This seminar will introduce students to the wide range of research methods that can be used to answer empirical questions, provide a framework for choosing among methods, and explain how to use the methods. The project for the quarter is to design an empirical research study on a topic of your choice. Special Instructions: JD students can take the class for 3-4 units. SPILS students must take this class for 4 units. Students taking the course for 4 units must attend the additional session on Thursday, which is optional for others. After the term begins, JD students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which can potentially satisfy the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Whether it is interviewing a potential new client, interrogating a witness in a deposition, or conducting a direct or cross examination at trial, knowing how to ask a question is an essential lawyering skill.  We'll explore textual materials and real life case examples in transcripts, videotape, and cinema to determine the principals and best practices for questioning.  We'll learn how to prepare for questioning, how to focus, narrow, and broaden an examination, how to obtain key admissions, how to deal with a difficult opponent, when to stop asking, and how to use what's been obtained in court or otherwise to win for your clients.  This course will give you the skills and tools needed for the critical roles of understanding your clients and your cases and successfully representing their causes.  There is no exam or paper.

Currently, plaintiffs can only show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment -  and several other antidiscrimination laws -  by proving intentional discrimination.  This seminar will examine this &quot;intent standard&quot; and its significant barriers to racial justice litigation.  The course will review social science research, including studies on implicit bias, racial anxiety, stereotyping, and other concepts, to explore how contemporary discrimination manifests.  We will address how legal advocates and the law can utilize such research to challenge and remedy discrimination through strategic litigation.  We will examine real-world examples of this, including in the context of school discipline and the school-to-prison pipeline.

How does and will the law treat this disruptive technology?  This course will study digital currency and other alternative payment mechanisms.  Interest in this topic has exploded in recent years, as Bitcoin and numerous brands of competitors have risen in value and are gaining increasing acceptance as payment devices.  Proponents of Bitcoin herald it as a better payment mechanism: lower transaction costs, international, more secure, the opportunity to bank the &quot;unbanked,&quot; and with a set protocol for increase in supply.  However, there are also legitimate and serious concerns about their use, including the worry that the anonymous nature of digital currency facilitates illegal transactions and money laundering.  These concerns have triggered a growing number of government actions.  The course will cover topics such as the origin and function of Bitcoin; examine the legal and regulatory treatment of digital currencies; and review recent enforcement trends in the criminal arena.

The European Court of Human Rights (based in Strasbourg, France) is a success story in many respects.  Founded after the Second World War the Court is the only guarantor and last instance for 47 countries from Russia to Switzerland.  Since its' creation in 1950, it has delivered nearly 20,000 judgements.  The 'living instrument' character of the European Convention has allowed the Court to generate expansive legal interpretations in a diverse array of cases, often on politically sensitive topics.  This constant evolution has prompted the European human right system to mature over the years.  Today, the Court faces important challenges, such as an increasing workload and government resistance, which this course will examine.  The course will be divided into 3 parts:  1) Introduction to the European System and its institutions.  The course begins with a general presentation of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights.  It gives an overview of the values, structure and achievements of the Council of Europe; it presents the organization, structure and procedure of the European Court of Human Rights; it outlines the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and key concepts essential to the understanding of European Convention system.  2) A short overview of the most important cases.  The course will introduce the students into the case law of European Court of Human Rights.  Cases concerning the rights guaranteed by the Convention will be presented through the perspective of the &quot;living Instrument&quot; character of the Convention.  The issue of extraterritoriality will be also examined.  3) In the last part, the course will examine the challenges that the European Court of Human Rights is being faced with.  The course will look at the evolution of the Court's position when dealing with controversial topics, its' increasing case load and respective measures, the potential adhesion of the European Union, as well as challenges related to the execution of judgements by reluctant governments.

This problem is exacerbated in the current world of increasingly smart, small and interconnected devices, where it has become even more difficult and annoying for consumers to read the terms and conditions before downloading software, using a new piece of hardware, or accessing a new web service. Moreover, consumer relationships over the internet often require individuals to disclose and relinquish control over personal data (about health, finances, and location), making the problem of informed consent even more consequential. It has become increasingly clear that simply mandating more textual disclosure is not a solution, particularly in a world where individuals struggle to sift, sort and process the vast amounts of information now available at low or zero cost. This presents a challenge that we address in this legal design lab: how can we present the complex and important information in a contract to lay people, so that they engage with it, comprehend and act on it in their own best interests?  In this class, students will tackle this consumer-contract design challenge.  In the first half of the course, they will study and discuss principles of contract design, theories of consumer consent, communication design, privacy scholarship, and behavioral economics to understand the dynamics of how lay people interact with legal text and choices, particularly in digital environments.  In the second half, they will work in teams to address a specific design challenge, engage knowledgeable experts from industry and generate new strategies and interfaces. They will engage in a design process beginning with discovery, to prototype, to testing their designs of consumer-facing contracts.  Elements used in grading:  The course grade will be based on the instructors' evaluation of: 1) individual responses to short-answer assignments based on the class readings, 2) class and team participation 3) the contract design, report and end-of-quarter presentation.

Now a critical area for the C-suite, board rooms, trading floor, political arenas and beyond, today's debate encompasses a range of complex topics, including the role of patents in promoting innovation, protecting market share and shaping technology; how patents can drive strategic and competitive advantage; proper valuation of assets; patent assertion entities that arose to take advantage of inefficiencies in the system; and what a balanced patent system requires.  As a framework for our class discussion of these topics, we will examine the market, legal and competitive forces that drove five major tech companies (Apple, Blackberry, Ericsson, Microsoft and Sony) to form a consortium called Rockstar to buy for $4.5B the the bankrupt technology giant Nortel Networks' massive patent portfolio.  Their move kept the patents out of the hands of another bidding consortium (Google and Intel), and Google's response to the loss included an acquisition of Motorola and its extensive patent portfolio for $12B.  We will then follow Rockstar's ensuing licensing campaign that led to eight patent lawsuits and nearly 30 patent validity challenges involving major competitors.  With dozens of additional offensive and defensive actions looming, industry observers predicted Armageddon as corporate relations continued to fray.  Instead, a groundbreaking resolution was brokered that all sides considered a success.  In what is recognized as the industry's most complex and innovative intellectual property deal, RPX, a public company focused on reducing patent risk, brought together a cross-industry syndicate of over 40 US and foreign licensee participants, including Google and Cisco, to purchase from Rockstar for $900M its remaining patent assets, resulting in a dismissal of all actions and a wind down of Rockstar forever.  This case study will be the basis of an interdisciplinary look at how patents, technology, competition and finance converge in the real world, including corporate, marketplace, policy and regulatory dynamics.  Instruction:  The class will be led by instructors Mark Chandler and Mallun Yen who will provide a unique insiders' view of the transaction and overall patent ecosystem as it intersects with business, technology and competition.  Guest speakers, including senior executives who were involved at each stage of the transaction, will provide even greater visibility into real-world dynamics and the players' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.  Additional guest speakers who are the foremost experts in their fields will drop in to discuss how similar challenges play out in their disciplines, including the nuclear arms race, providing further opportunity to deepen understanding as we explore ways in which the patent system might evolve to better address modern technology and business needs.  Subject Matter Covered:  Students will gain practical insights into how patent, business, competitive, and marketplace dynamics interplay in the real world, as well as participate in deal structuring, consortium-building, and valuation exercises.  No technical or legal background is required.  Class Format:  The expected class format will include a focused substantive discussion followed by either a senior executive guest speaker or a class exercise.

The focus will be on the quantitative aspects of private equity investing. The primary pedagogical objective is to have students learn the skills required to do financial analysis and spreadsheet modeling. Students will develop a thorough understanding of &quot;the time value of money&quot; and the concepts of present value, internal rates of return, and the discounting of cash flows and annuity streams.  The key principles of entrepreneurial finance and deal arithmetic will be presented, including the implied valuation of an investment, blended returns, the math of multitiered capital structures, contingent claims analysis, DCF valuation techniques, investment fund economics, option mechanics and variable pricing mechanisms.  Mastery of these fundamentals will allow students to develop and strengthen their ability to prepare forecasts, craft deal structures and run the numbers on real world transactions.  Special Instructions:  In order to enroll in PEI:  Quantitative Skills students must concurrently enroll in Private Equity Investing (LAW 522).  In other words, no student may enroll in either Law 522 or Law 721 without also enrolling in the other.

Through this class students gain an understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities the legal system and the legal industry are facing and learn about innovative new systems seeking to address them. Students will be introduced to technologies that are commonly used for legal research, as well matter management and client management by law firms as well as in-house departments. Students will also be familiarized with the next generation of innovative systems and platforms that challenge the way law has been practiced to date, but also promise to increase the efficiency of our legal system.  The class modules include: (i) Legal Document Management (including electronic legal research, e-discovery, specialized legal databases), (ii) Legal Infrastructure (including: case management, legal lead generation, managing the firms legal business process and legal process outsourcing), and (iii) Computational Law (including: legal expert systems, computable contracts, and unauthorized practice of law issues).  Expert guest-speakers from academia and industry will provide for a diverse and interdisciplinary experience. Successful legal technology entrepreneurs and thought leaders in the legal technology space will provide a practical angle to the discussion.  Special Instructions:  Grades will be based on class participation including class preparation (25% of grade) and one of the following two options:  Option 1 (section 01):  Legal Technology Project (individual or group). Students will be presented with a series of research problems posed by industry partners of CodeX - The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics (http:\/\/codex.stanford.edu).  Students can select a project and, individually or as part of a team, address the posed problem in form of a written report or by preparing a technical demonstration project\/prototype that aims to solve the problem posed by the industry partner (75% of grade); or Option 2 (section 02): independent research paper (75% of grade).  Students shall write an independent research paper on a legal informatics topic. You are invited to propose a topic and a working title and to discuss your topic ideas with us. The topic and the working title of the research paper must be approved by the instructors, before you start your detailed research. Independent research papers require by definition that students include other research materials besides the introductory and advanced readings for class.  Students electing option 2 will receive Research (R) credit.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the length of the research paper.  If you wish to earn 2 units, the research paper shall be at least 18 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins). If you wish to earn 3 units, the research paper shall be at least 26 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins).

After more than ten years, this question is still hotly debated around the world. Network neutrality rules allow users to decide how they want to use the Internet without interference from Internet service providers.  After a long, public fight that mobilized more than 4 million people in the US, the Federal Communications Commission adopted strong net neutrality rules in February 2015. But the debate over net neutrality is far from over. The FCC's net neutrality rules are under attack in Congress and in Court. At the same time, Internet service providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, or T-Mobile are pushing the boundaries of the FCC's rules by exempting select applications from users' data caps -- a practice known as &quot;zero-rating&quot; --, by degrading quality or requesting fees when data enters their networks, or by trying to evade the FCC's rules in other ways. At the same time, Facebook and Wikipedia are arguing that exceptions from net neutrality rules are necessary in developing countries to bring the next billion people online. In all of these cases, policy makers need to decide what the right policy should be.  Through a mix of lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, this seminar provides an introduction to net neutrality and explores some of the net neutrality issues that policy makers around the world are currently grappling with.

Few copyright licenses today fail to reach across borders, and copyright litigation increasingly calls for a general understanding of foreign law.  One great challenge for lawyers is to determine who owns the rights to these works across countries with differing legal systems.  Another challenge is to determine what rights and remedies attach to these works, and what exceptions to rights apply, across countries that assign different policy weights to the interests of creators and users.  This course will focus on the counselling considerations that surround the exploitation of foreign and domestic copyrighted works, respectively, in US and foreign markets through licensing, litigation, or both.

Course lectures and discussions will focus on questions such as:  Did different legal regimes (Spanish, French, British) foster different systems of race and slavery in the Americas? How did\/does law work &quot;on the ground&quot; to shape the production of racial hierarchy and creation of racial identities?  In what ways did slavery influence the U.S. Constitution? How has race shaped citizenship in the U.S., and how can we compare it to other constitutional regimes?

Although the U.S. Supreme Court has steadily narrowed the scope for U.S. class actions, other jurisdictions see the procedure as appropriate for resolving securities, antitrust, consumer and personal injury claims.  Some jurisdictions have invited business to resolve trans-national claims against them in their own domestic courts, and plaintiff attorneys who cannot obtain class certification in U.S. courts coordinate non-class mass actions with class action attorneys outside the U.S.  Stanford is collaborating with the University of Windsor (Ontario) and Tilburg University (the Netherlands) law schools to offer a 1-credit seminar on these developments. Using a combination of synchronous and a-synchronous on-line communication, faculty and students at the 3 law schools will describe and analyze differences and similarities among the 3 countries (quite different) class action regimes.  The class will meet weekly (sometimes separately by school and sometimes with faculty and students from the 3 schools together virtually) and SLS students will work with students at the other 2 institutions to research issues that cut across all three jurisdictions.  This is a great opportunity to discover how lawyers in non-U.S. jurisdictions think about problems that arise trans-nationally, and some of the student you encounter in the seminar may be the practitioners you will litigate besides or against in future global litigation.

When, in light of these features, is the recourse to armed force justified?  Pacifists argue that because war is so violent it is never justified, and that there is no such thing as a just war.  Realists, in contrast, argue that war is simply a fact of life and not a proper subject for moral judgment, any more than we would judge an attack by a pack of wolves in moral terms.  In between is just war theory, which claims that some wars, but not all, are morally justified.  We will explore these theories, and will consider how just war theory comports with international law rules governing recourse to force.  We will also explore justice in war, that is, the moral and legal rules governing the conduct of war, such as the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants.  Finally, we will consider how war should be terminated; what should be the nature of justified peace?  We will critically evaluate the application of just war theory in the context of contemporary security problems, including: (1) transnational conflicts between states and nonstate groups and the so-called &quot;war on terrorism&quot;; (2) civil wars; (3) demands for military intervention to halt humanitarian atrocities taking place in another state.

Over the past decade, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon.  As these ad hoc institutions wind down, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has become fully functional, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency.  Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria-among others-go unanswered.  This intensive mini-course in the new September Term will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international criminal justice and to the political environment in which it operates. The classroom component (offered at Stanford during the first week of the course) will offer an elemental analysis of international crimes as they have evolved in international law and focus on the challenges of interpreting these norms in a criminal prosecution.  Jurisprudence from the various international tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof.  The course will culminate in a visit to The Hague in the second week of the course, during which time students will meet with principals from the tribunals, including prosecutors, judges, administrators, and members of the defense bar.  In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design.

The course investigates these issues as they operate in a range of specific contexts in public health, including the control and prevention of infectious disease; laws aimed at preventing obesity and associated noncommunicable diseases; tobacco regulation; ensuring access to medical care; reproductive health; lawsuits against tobacco, food, and gun companies; and public health emergencies. In these contexts, we will ask and answer questions such as, what do the Constitution and key statutes permit?  What makes a good public health law?  What does public health evidence tell us about the likely effectiveness of particular legal interventions?  What ethical and economic arguments justify government intervention to shape individuals' and companies' health-related behaviors?

Numerous adjectives have been applied to describe a trend toward austerity -- death, demise, withering, reversal. One writer suggested that the welfare state had not died, it had merely &quot;moved to Asia&quot; along with industrialization. This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigration. We will then turn to the trend toward austerity and retrenchment, and the effect of globalization for the future of the welfare state.  Course Requirements.  Participation\/Discussion (25%). Students are responsible to complete all readings and to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussion. Each student is responsible to lead a portion of the discussion twice per quarter.  Short Reaction Papers (25%). All students must complete 5 reaction papers related to the weekly readings of 2 to 3 pages in length. Reaction papers will include a list of questions to be addressed in that week's discussion. All reaction papers must be posted to coursework in advance of class so that the student(s) leading that week's discussion can incorporate the questions into that week's discussion.  Final Options (50%). Students have the option of completing one final paper of 20 pages in length OR 4 essays of 5 -6 pages each addressing the readings in weeks that the student did NOT complete reaction papers. Topics for 20 page papers must be approved by me in advance, and may be related to a student's dissertation or master's research or may be a stand-alone topic. Papers may take the form of a research proposal and need not contain original empirical research. Shorter papers should engage thoroughly with the literature on the selected topic, and should bring additional sources other than those read for class to bear on the topic of choice.

This seminar will examine digital disruptions to the business models of content creators and industries, and the corresponding impact of the Internet on copyright law, largely through the lens of the litigation involving Google Books. That litigation, which has been active in the courts for almost a decade, is a microcosm of the vast issues that have faced content owners and consumers in the digital age: new technologies to reproduce and distribute works, evolving concepts of fair use, changing consumer norms, massive disruptions to economic interests, increased access to information, concerns about piracy, and threats to competition. We will examine issues related to copyright and content in the digital age by focusing not only on legal claims and defenses, but also litigation strategy, business strategy, policy strategy and public relations strategy, all of which play an important part in the art of lawyering today. The seminar will explore in depth the many contours of the Google Books litigation, including transformative fair use, the problem of orphan works, the rise of ebooks, non-display use and the proposed class action settlement of the case, which was rejected by the district court in 2011. We will also examine digital developments in other content industries (movie, music and newspaper) and focus on two related book issues: the ebook antitrust case against both publishers and Apple and the frequent disputes between publishers and Amazon. The seminar will include visitors who have been involved in the issues being studied. Grading will be based upon weekly reflections, class participation and (for those opting for Research credit) a long paper based on independent research. Some copyright experience is recommended.

Among other subjects, we will discuss and problematize: the impact of colonialism, urbanization and other political, legal, economic, religious and cultural forces on understandings and definitions of &quot;indigenous&quot; and &quot;cultural heritage&quot;; the development of international law relating to Indigenous peoples' cultural rights; domestic heritage protection and repatriation legislation such as the 1990 US Indian Arts and Crafts Act and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act; past and present Western museum practices relating to display, preservation, provenance research and repatriation of Indigenous peoples' cultural material; the meaning of repatriation to Indigenous peoples and other stakeholders; and resolving repatriation disputes, including by alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes. While case studies will relate primarily to Indigenous peoples of North America, including the Arizona Hopi and Northwest Coast First Nations, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of Indigenous peoples in other regions, such as Oceania and Russia. The overall seminar experience will involve discussions of lectures and video content, assigned readings, a class visit to the Cantor Center Native Americas collection, and visits to our classroom by renowned experts, including Dr. Morten Rasmussen, who participated in the recent DNA analysis of Kennewick Man\/The Ancient One.

We shall explore the friction between ideology and practice within the dynasty's formal legal system, but also the field of customary practice that flourished outside the formal system, sometimes in conflict with it.

One important theme is how scholarly interpretation and debate have changed over time, especially as a result of the opening of Qing legal archives for research. Another theme is the question of what concepts and vocabulary are most appropriate for this field of study. What are the advantages and disadvantages of analyzing the Chinese legal tradition in comparison to the West? Is it possible to understand it &quot;on its own terms&quot;?

Documents from executed transactions are highly customized. By taking a forensic and cross-disciplinary approach, looking at several different deals, we can learn how project developers, financiers, and lawyers work to get deals over the finish line that meet the demands of the market, the requirements of the law, and (sometimes) broader societal goals, in particular climate change, economic competitiveness, and energy security.

Public interest lawyers practicing in these transitional countries, where the pace of political and economic change is accelerating rapidly are called upon to occupy unique and critical leadership roles. These leaders face an increasingly complex tapestry of economic, political, and social challenges.  This course will examine the leadership challenges and opportunities faced by both domestic and international public interest lawyers in transitional societies.  Guest speakers who have led international NGOs and foreign NGOs advocating for social justice in transitional societies will anchor many of the class discussions.  Readings will largely focus on practitioner-oriented case studies and evaluations.  Themes addressed will include:  * Globalization is advancing rapidly. Leaders must understand how new rules of the game for global governance will affect organizations. They must develop the technical and political skills to be heard in international arenas at the same time that they mediate the impact of global change on the economic and social futures of their countries.  * Decentralization of decision-making authority creates more challenges. Leaders in times of transition must understand how to build coalitions and negotiate across multiple layers of government and networks of interested parties.  * Democratization and political participation are increasing. Public interest legal organizations and a variety of other organizations in civil society must develop the skill sets necessary to make claims on government at all levels and are hold leaders more accountable for their actions. Increasing political participations requires effective movement building skills which are often underdeveloped in these societies.  * Knowledge is expanding exponentially. Leaders must spend more time acquiring knowledge for informed decision making and must guide their organizations in adapting new technologies and new knowledge to improve performance and responsiveness to the needs of their constituencies.  * Regulatory environments are uncertain. Leaders of NGOs in transitional societies are often operating in an environment of rapidly changing regulatory environments with respect to legal compliance and governance for NGOs.  * Overwhelming numbers of critical priorities compete for organizational time and resources.  In transitional societies there are typically very few NGOs and many pressing needs with respect to representing and serving marginalized communities and expanding political participation across the board. Organizational leadership can succumb to mission creep and burnout.  Guest speakers will include:  Dmitri Holtzman, Founder and Executive Director of the Equal Education Law Centre (EELC). EELC is dedicated to advancing the right to basic education through strategic litigation and advocacy in South Africa. Prior to his work with EELC, Dmitri worked with Equal Education, a movement seeking to address poor quality and inequality in education.  Hou Ping, Hou Ping is the founder and Vice President of LesGo, a nonprofit organization working on LGBT rights in China. LesGo advocates for recognition of and equality for the LGBT community in Suzhou and  surrounding areas. In her role as Vice President, Ping focuses on community research and rights.

The course will also explore the range of transitional justice mechanisms available to policymakers as societies emerge from periods of violence and repression, including truth commissions, lustrations, and amnesties. Coming full circle, the course will evaluate current efforts aimed at atrocity prevention, rather than response, including President Obama's atrocities prevention initiative.

As the late William J. Stuntz wrote in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice: &quot;Rule of law has vanished in America's criminal justice system. Prosecutors decide whom to punish; most accused never face a jury; policing is inconsistent; plea bargaining is rampant; and draconian sentencing fills prisons with mostly minority defendants.&quot; There is no controversy that change is needed, and many believe we are now at a policy turning point. For the first time in nearly 40 years, prison populations are declining and a variety of forces-fiscal, political, and evidentiary-have finally come together to create broad-based support for reconstituting components of the American criminal justice system. But good intentions are not enough, and a policy opportunity is not the same thing as a policy success. This historic opportunity requires a thoughtfully planned, multidisciplinary effort. This seminar is designed to engage in that effort. Each student will be asked to select a particular area of potential reform (e.g., police, prisons, prosecution, sentencing, plea bargaining, parole release, risk prediction, juvenile justice, mental health, drug policy, racial disparities, parole), and to offer a comprehensive concrete proposal for change. The final paper will offer plans for reconstituting that particular component of the criminal justice system. The concrete proposals must be justified in terms of the pertinent legal and empirical research. The goal of each paper is to provide policymakers with a practical blueprint for choosing a different criminal justice future. This course is designed for students who wish to delve deeply into specific areas of criminal justice reform, and have an interest in policy reform, empirical research, and advocacy.

The first part of the course will consider alternative accounts of the central problems at the intersection of race and law enforcement, and will explore the roots of distrust between minority communities and law enforcement agencies. The course will examine the social, psychological, historical and institutional roots of these problems.  The second part of the course will survey various reform proposals.  What are the possibilities and limits of civil rights actions? Is reform best undertaken by courts or legislatures? By the federal government or by states? Some reforms focus on prosecutors, e.g. limiting prosecutorial discretion, eliminating grand juries. Other reforms focus on policing, e.g. racial sensitivity or procedural justice training, requiring body cameras, creating more racially representative police forces. To what extent should solutions be pursued through new forms of democratic oversight and accountability (such as police civilian review boards) or through community organizing efforts. Does racially just and effective policing require controlling and constraining the police, or working collaboratively with law enforcement agencies?

These are just a few examples of alleged corporate malfeasance that have emerged on the international stage.  The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the debate concerning the accountability of transnational corporations that are complicit in rights-violating activities.  At the international level, there has been a striking new strategy in the protection of human rights: a transition from focusing solely on rights-violations committed by governments to a detailed examination of transnational corporate conduct.  Indeed, it has now become trite to say that particular corporations have directly or indirectly participated in violations of human rights.  In order to address the fundamental question of whether corporations should in fact be socially responsible, the seminar will begin with an introduction to corporate theory.  Students will then explore some of the key issues in the debate.  Namely, whether transnational corporations can properly be included under the international law of state responsibility; mechanisms for self-regulation (e.g. voluntary corporate codes of conduct); the utility of the U.S. Alien Tort Claims Act; the advantages and disadvantages of U.N. initiatives (e.g. the work of the former U.N. Special Representative on Business and Human Rights); and the relevance of domestic corporate and securities law mechanisms (e.g. shareholder proposals and social disclosure).

But we will be most concerned with how the Executive conceptualizes and implements its &quot;Take Care&quot; responsibilities and its relationship to Congress, through its own forms of constitutional interpretation and when implementing statutes and exercising enforcement discretion. We will begin with the question-what is executive power?  We then will study the work of different interpreters within the Executive Branch, such as the Office of Legal Counsel, the White House Counsel, OIRA, and the agencies, mindful of the fact that the branch is a &quot;they,&quot; not an &quot;it.&quot; We will conclude by studying various policy dilemmas that have required the Executive to conceptualize and assert a view of its authority within the constitutional system, including its use of prosecutorial discretion and its foreign affairs, war, and Commander-in-Chief powers.

Civil rights plaintiffs have difficulty prevailing even when their fact-patterns are sympathetic, as can be seen in contexts from sexual harassment lawsuits to wage to hour claims and from police brutality and prison conditions cases to transnational human rights complaints. Yet when public interest impact litigation does succeed it can enable or even galvanize social movements-both domestic and international-and meaningfully change the legal landscape. This class will focus on the skills necessary to litigate public interest lawsuits, and, in particular, public interest impact litigation. We will focus on marrying research and analysis of statutory text and case law and harnessing the creativity necessary to win such lawsuits by using those research and analytical results to write two briefs from the perspective of public interest or pro-bono advocates. Along the way, we will examine some of the most important briefs of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in various public interest contexts to unpack the rhetorical and analytical skills needed to persuade judges across the ideological spectrum.

No prior knowledge of finance will be assumed.  If you want an introduction to corporate finance and won't take the full 3 credit course, this is for you.  The first part of the course (approximately 6 weeks) will consist of on-line modules and problem sets that you will complete on your own and in small groups.  We will cover topics such as: earnings, cash flows, income statements, interest rates, time value of money, estimating firm value, risk and return and the cost of capital.  We will provide a framework for answering questions such as:  how much is this project (or firm) worth?  How should the firm raise money for a new investment?  There will be weekly problem sets and you will get experience with building a simple model (excel spreadsheet) that will help you estimate the value of a potential new project.  The second part of the course will consist of in-class discussions of case studies that apply these valuation principles to particular legal settings:  e.g. valuing settlement offers, merger proposals, appraisal proceedings, and the efficient capital markets hypothesis.  We hope that this flexible format will allow more students to take finance.  If you wish, you can take this course and then later take Corporate Finance 1.  The class will meet (TBA).

Students will examine the major instruments for human rights protections in the IASHR, the Inter-American Court and Commission's procedure and jurisprudence, as well as the obstacles and opportunities that civil society, victims, and advocates encounter when engaging the inter-American system.  The Course will consider issues of implementation, and the types of measures and forms of relief that can be sought from the Court and the Commission. The inter-American system has played a crucial role in opening spaces for debate on human rights protections in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing protections at the domestic level, and supporting civil society in its quest for accountability for massive human rights violations.  The system has also played a role in civil society efforts to bring the human rights debate home, including in the United States.  Students will have an opportunity to cast a comparative look at the inter-American and the European Human Rights systems and to consider the comparative advantages, disadvantages and complementary potential of regional human rights systems and universal international human rights and criminal justice bodies.  Cross Registration: This Course is open to graduate students across the university, with permission of the instructor.  Preference for cross-registration by non-Law School students will be given to students enrolled in the Master of Arts program in Latin American Studies.

Warning: Over the past three years, the issue of campus sexual assault has exploded into the public discourse. While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by what they describe as an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators. These survivors have launched one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. As a result, the federal government has stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with 124 colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints as of July 2015.  This courses focuses on the legal, policy, and political issues surrounding sexual assault on college campuses. The class is rigorous and includes substantial reading over the summer and during the course. We will spend the first week of the course learning some background about sexual violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for survivors. We will study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. During the second week we will travel to Washington, D.C., where we will meet with journalists, activists, experts, policymakers, elected officials, and others who are actively involved in shaping the national response to this issue. Expected guests speakers include Catherine Lhamon, the Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights; Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA); lawyers from the National Women's Law Center; the Legislative Director for Senator Kristin Gillibrand (D.N.Y.); Kirby Dick, the director of the acclaimed documentary the Hunting Ground; and many of the activists who appear in the film, as well as journalists, policymakers, and theorists. We will also visit sites and museums with relevant exhibits. On our return to campus students will create and present final projects.  Travel expenses to DC (except incidentals) are provided by Sophomore College. Students are expected to do all readings, and participate in all class sessions, meals, field trips, films, and discussions. Requirements include 2-3 reaction papers, preparing for discussions with outside speakers, and the development and presentation of a final paper or final group-designed project which can include a multi-media or artistic component. The subject matter of this course is sensitive and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and\/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources and Title IX staff are available for those who need them. Please consider this prior to enrolling in the course.  Sophomore College course, application required, due noon, April 5, 2016.

Over 360 Indian reservations, the majority of which are in the western United States, encompass over 56 million acres - a land total approximating the size of the State of Idaho  While Indian treaties and executive orders often relegated tribes to isolated and unwanted lands, Indian reservations frequently contain valuable natural resources such as oil, gas, hard minerals, and forests.  Many Indian tribes, moreover, enjoy special fishing rights and the legal right to vast amounts of water.  At the same time, Indian reservations face serious environmental challenges, including water contamination, habitat decline, and climate change.  To examine these questions, we will start with a week of classroom study and discussion.  During this week, we will examine the nature of the environmental and resource challenges facing Native American tribes today, the relevant ins and outs of federal Indian law and the legal rights of tribes, Native American governmental systems, and the approaches that tribes are currently taking to these challenges.  We will then move into the field and spend approximately ten days in the states of Washington, Montana, and Wyoming, meeting with tribal officials and seeing firsthand the environmental and resource challenges that they face.  On our return to Stanford, students will break into groups, and each group will analyze a particular challenge facing a Native American tribe and how best to address that challenge.  The course will culminate in student presentations on these analyses.  Over the summer, students also will be responsible for assigned readings, online interactive materials, and relevant recent news articles.  The class begins on-campus and then travels to Washington, Montana, and Wyoming.

Most businesses don't consider men for women's locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren't those men and women's bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation? After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn't it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people, or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We will answer these and many other questions by looking at court cases, legal theory, and philosophy. We may also have conversations with guest lecturers who work in civil rights enforcement, and the seminar may include a field trip to visit the offices of civil rights lawyers (lawyers tend to be busy people so these opportunities will depend on their schedules).

What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in human rights advocacy? In the space of 60 years, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discussion, if not practice. In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.  This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.). The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights; 4) to understand how recent  history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice.

These are some of the questions we will address by reading major empirical studies evaluating the impact of law and policy in the arena of criminal justice. This course has been modified from my law school course so that it is accessible to those with little or no statistical or economic background but who are willing to grapple with the intuitions behind such studies, which will be a main focus of the course readings. The seminar should appeal to anyone interested in understanding core issues in criminal justice policy, the challenges in answering empirical questions with data, and the intuition behind the statistical techniques that define the credibility revolution in empirical evaluation. The goal is to help students be more aware that many beliefs and policy positions are based on factual premises for which the empirical support is weak or nonexistent, or even directly contradictory, and how better to empirically ascertain truths about the world and align them with our policy preferences. Successful completion of the course will enable students to more effectively understand and critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the empirical studies that constantly appear in the media and policy discourse, to comprehend the challenges in establishing true causal relationships in the fields of law, policy, and medicine, and to better understand how ideologues and motivated researchers contribute to the vast array of conflicting studies in these domains.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-AQR","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AQR","description":"distinguish between causal and correlational evidence, as well as recognize when the available evidence is too weak to decide a matter."},{"code":"WAY-AQR","description":"recognize common mistakes that human beings make in empirical reasoning and quantitative problem solving including critical examination of the work of others."},{"code":"WAY-AQR","description":"choose appropriate probabilistic or empirical models for a given problem, using information from observed data and knowledge of the system being studied."},{"code":"WAY-AQR","description":"analyze data and apply empirical methods to solve relevant problems, guide decision-making, and\/or answer questions of wide concern."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use strategies for basing conclusions about society in data including causal reasoning, historical contextualization, hypothesis testing, modeling, and critical analysis of behavior and institutions."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":27448,"component":"ISF","curr_class_size":16,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":16,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Dec 4, 2015","end_time":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"John","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Donohue","middle_name":"J","name":"Donohue, J.","sunet_id":"jjd"}],"location":"William H.
