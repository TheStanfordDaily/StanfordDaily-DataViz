Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2019-2020"},"5":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

What is the good life?  How do we change ourselves to live a good and happy life?  How do literature and philosophy help us to understand ourselves and to achieve our social, ethical, and personal ideals? In this class, we examine Socrates and Augustine's lives and ideas.  Each struggled to live a good and happy life.  In each case, they urge us to transform ourselves into better human beings.  The first half of the course focuses on the Athenian Socrates, who was put to death because he rejected traditional Greek ideals and and proclaimed a new kind of ethical goodness.  The second half focuses on the North African Augustine, an unhappy soul who became a new man by converting to Christianity.  These thinkers addressed questions and problems that we still confront today:  What do we consider to be a happy life?  Do we need to be good and ethical people to live happily?

As another example, the setting up of large hunting reserves for nobility in the medieval period preserved green areas, which later could be converted to large parks.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":31098,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Tuesday seminar will be held in 200-013.

In addressing these questions, we will read texts by Viktor Shklovsky, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Susan Sontag, among others. We will attend Tosca at the San Francisco Opera, the Susan Meiselas exhibition at SFMoMA, as well as street art and the home of the conceptual artist David Ireland in the Mission District of San Francisco. We will also have a class visit by the St. Lawrence String Quartet and attend a performance by the musician Nitin Sawhney with the dancer\/choreographers WangRamirez on campus. In order to make talking about art a part of daily life, students taking ITALIC live together in Burbank and eat lunch with their professors after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

ITALIC will address these questions in lecture and see art on and off campus, including performances of Gloria the new play by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and the ballet Rite of Spring choreographed by Yang Liping.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19038,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meeting will take place in Burbank Hall.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ryan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tacata","middle_name":"David","name":"Tacata, R.","sunet_id":"rtacata"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19037,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meeting will take place in Burbank Hall.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"3:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ryan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tacata","middle_name":"David","name":"Tacata, R.","sunet_id":"rtacata"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19036,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":7,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meeting will take place in Burbank Hall.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Kim","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Beil","middle_name":"","name":"Beil, K.","sunet_id":"kbeil"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":19025,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":22,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Lecture held in Burbank Hall.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Karla","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Oeler","middle_name":"","name":"Oeler, K.","sunet_id":"koeler"},{"first_name":"Ryan","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tacata","middle_name":"David","name":"Tacata, R.","sunet_id":"rtacata"},{"first_name":"Kim","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Beil","middle_name":"","name":"Beil, K.","sunet_id":"kbeil"},{"first_name":"Nicholas","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Jenkins","middle_name":"","name":"Jenkins, N.","sunet_id":"njenkins"},{"first_name":"Heather","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hadlock","middle_name":"L","name":"Hadlock, H.","sunet_id":"hhadlock"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"ITALIC","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture, Interpreting","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"32":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"93","course_id":214685,"description":"ITALIC 93, Challenging.

We trace the challenges that works of art have presented to categories of knowledge--history, politics, culture, science, medicine, law--by turning reality upside-down or inside-out, or just by altering one's perspective on the world. The arts become a model for engaging with problem-solving: uncertainty and ambiguity confront art makers and viewers all the time; artworks are experiments that work by different sets of rules. Students will begin to understand and use the arts to create new frameworks for exploring our (and others') experience.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18564,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":16,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in the Burbank Lecture Theater.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"Departmental Room","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":19113,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in the Burbank Lecture Theater.","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 3, 2020","end_time":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"Departmental Room","start_date":"Mar 30, 2020","start_time":"4:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":19056,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in the Burbank Lecture Theater.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"Departmental Room","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"ITALIC","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture, Writing Section","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"34":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"99","course_id":219835,"description":"Student-led courses in the arts.

Most improv forgoes a predetermined, studied character. Improv is usually completely devised in the moment but implementing character study can change the art of improv in several ways. This course will explore what character-based improv entails, and the degree to which it affects the rules of improv (e.g. \u00bfyes and\u00bf, dare to be boring). We then will bring this understanding into application by delving into the world of tabletop roleplaying, featuring students acting as self or instructor-designed characters inside a scenario described by the instructor using the existing framework of such games. This course is open to students with any level of experience- including none! The class will be low-pressure and no student will have to participate if they feel uncomfortable in doing so. Students can expect to do the majority of all work within the class itself, with little to no work required outside of class time.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 3, 2020","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Karla","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Oeler","middle_name":"","name":"Oeler, K.","sunet_id":"koeler"},{"first_name":"Kim","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Beil","middle_name":"","name":"Beil, K.","sunet_id":"kbeil"},{"first_name":"Erik","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Yingling","middle_name":"Odin","name":"Yingling, E.","sunet_id":"eyinglin"}],"location":"","start_date":"Mar 30, 2020","start_time":""}],"section_num":"04","term":"2019-2020 Spring","units":"1"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":19304,"component":"INS","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":12,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Student Instructor: Hana\/Connor Yankowitz.

In many ways, medieval stoneware pottery of Tamba and Japan&iquest;s other &iquest;six ancient kilns&iquest; can be seen as forebears of what we now know as the wabi-sabi aesthetic of Japanese tea culture.  Today, surviving heirloom pieces such as jars (tsubo) and flower vessels (hanaire) serve as inspirational archetypes for surging international interest in the revival of styles and methods of traditional Japanese wood-fired ceramics (yakishime).  In this Bing Overseas Seminar, Stanford students will travel to Tamba to undertake an intensive introduction to forming and firing clay.  Lectures, discussions and studio demos will build a broad view of traditional aesthetic elements of yakishime, but at the same time, students will be encouraged to explore a modern individualistic approach to creative process to help them develop their own expressive forms.  The seminar culminates in a traditional wood firing reaching kiln temperatures in excess of 2300F, which is a process that one must experience first-hand to viscerally comprehend.  A final critique of student work will probe the complex interplay of natural materials, creative vision, manual skills and serendipity in this most ancient yet vital paragon of the arts of fire.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":23980,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Summer","units":"2"}],"subject":"OSPGEN","tags":[],"title":"Stoking an ancient flame: Ceramics intensive in Tamba","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2019-2020"},"59":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"OVERSEAS","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"code":"60","course_id":222231,"description":"Through place-based exploration of the Khumbu Valley, Nepal, this field seminar focuses on the complex relationships between mountain and glacial geomorphology, culture and religion, land use in extreme environments, climate change, and sustainable resource development and management.

Topics for particular study could include &quot;expressionism,&quot; &quot;phenomenology,&quot; &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit,&quot; the Bauhaus, &quot;epic theater,&quot; proletarian art, and early German cinema, more or less following the organization of the Sourcebook.  The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.  Students will be encouraged to base their written projects on these events and on research at local archives, such as the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bauhaus-Museum.  Trips to institutions in other cities (Dessau, Weimar, etc.) could also be considered.  Primarily in English, but some topics might require German. n nThe Symphony  Material covered in this independent study could be adjusted to the student's interest and knowledge,  depending on his\/her level of musical literacy.  He\/she could focus on cultural history or on more technical, analytical  issues.  The aim will be to trace the history of the genre from its roots in the early 18th century to the present day using  mainly works from the established repertory as examples.  Visits to live performances in Berlin may also be included. n nBeethoven in German Culture  Following last year's elections in Germany, the draft coalition contract included the  following statement: &quot;The 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in 2020 offers excellent opportunities for profiling  German culture at home and abroad. Preparing for this important anniversary is thus of national concern.&quot; How and why  did Beethoven become so crucially important in German culture? In trying to answer this question, the course will begin  with a survey of Beethoven's life and works, and then focus on his legacy via key moments in reception history.

Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers.

Most broadly, this course hopes to provide historical and sociopolitical context to what being Asian American means in the present day and how to provide concrete skills to engage with Asian American identity and the community.

This course will provide an overview of documentary, experimental, and hybrid films that proffer an unexpected and sometimes disturbing perspective on cities, both here and abroad. We will examine films that privilege artistic expression and expand the conventions of the film form, analyzing how filmmakers distill an issue, situation, or environment through a particular formal style and point-of-view.nnThrough a consideration of iconic historic films, the student will gain a rich understanding of how cities have inspired filmmakers who work outside the traditional fiction genre.

The first part of the quarter will focus on sustainability and the second on resilience. n nThe course will commence with an overview of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as defined by the United Nations and how New York City is working towards these goals. The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class. Issues of resilience will be discussed in relation to major disasters including floods, extreme storms and climate change. The 7 global resilience targets will be identified according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The major components of resilience will be reviewed in class followed by a visit to or by a representative from the 100 Resilient City Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Superstorm Sandy in 2012 will be used as a case study to identify the disaster impact to the urban environment in NYC. We will discuss the emergency response of the City after Sandy and assess the performance of the NYC resilience plan. We will explore how New York City is preparing to respond and recover from future major disasters as part of the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. n nNovel technologies will be discussed in terms of their implications for disaster resilience and sustainability. We will delve into a case study showing how modern and decentralized power systems with rooftop solar panels and microgrids can make NYC more resilient and sustainable.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-AQR"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":35184,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":"3-4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":34618,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Spring","units":"3-4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30322,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":5,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Anne","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Kiremidjian","middle_name":"S","name":"Kiremidjian, A.","sunet_id":"ask"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":"3-4"}],"subject":"SINY","tags":[{"name":"socchange","organization":"URBANST"},{"name":"envirsuselect","organization":"URBANST"}],"title":"Sustainable and Resilient Urban Systems in NYC","units_max":4,"units_min":3,"year":"2019-2020"},"492":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGNYC","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"164","course_id":221793,"description":"Taxi Driver, All About Eve, Do the Right Thing, Sex and the City &iquest; the list goes on and on.

How do art, activism and racial justice connect in performances aimed at changing ideas?  How do major arts institutions address questions of equity and difference? We will discuss how art can function as a form of aesthetic knowledge in the service of justice.  In doing so, we will grapple with the role of the creative arts in mitigating social change and study artists who have sought to intervene in the restrictive covenants of racial, gender and other segregationist or national orders.  Our case studies will shift across media, subjects, objects and temporalities.

Each week you will be expected to read a short, but dense, section of the Ethics, and to share responsibility for asking questions.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Satisfactory\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":1,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":34706,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":7,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Friday"],"end_date":"Mar 13, 2020","end_time":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jeremy","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sabol","middle_name":"D","name":"Sabol, J.","sunet_id":"jsabol"},{"first_name":"Katherine","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Kretler","middle_name":"Lisa","name":"Kretler, K.","sunet_id":"kretler"}],"location":"200-015","start_date":"Jan 6, 2020","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Winter","units":"1"}],"subject":"SLE","tags":[],"title":"Reading Aristotle's Ethics: Happiness and the Virtues of Character (CLASSICS 60)","units_max":1,"units_min":1,"year":"2019-2020"},"500":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"H&S","academic_org":"SLE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"61","course_id":222424,"description":"In this course we continue our reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, moving from the individual moral virtues to his formative discussion of justice and equity.

Much of our attention will be focused on friendship, without which, as Aristotle says, no one would wish to live, and which is central to virtue and happiness. At the same time we strive to develop our capacity for friendship in ourselves, using Aristotle's discussion to help us reflect on our own lives.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Satisfactory\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":1,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":35859,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Friday"],"end_date":"Jun 10, 2020","end_time":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Katherine","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Kretler","middle_name":"Lisa","name":"Kretler, K.","sunet_id":"kretler"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 6, 2020","start_time":"3:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Spring","units":"1"}],"subject":"SLE","tags":[],"title":"Reading Aristotle's Ethics, Part 2 (CLASSICS 61)","units_max":1,"units_min":1,"year":"2019-2020"},"501":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SLE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"81","course_id":218821,"description":"This one-unit course is for participation in quarter-long service programs set up by the SLE program and conducted in consultation with the Haas Public Service Center.

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

We will start with the 18th century discovery of the relationship between coal tar and cancer, and trace the role of scientific research in revealing the genetic basis of cancer. We will then discuss the development of new treatments for cancer as well as measures to screen for and prevent cancer, including the ongoing debate over tobacco control. Using cancer as a case study, you will learn important aspects of the scientific method including experimental design, data analysis, and the difference between correlation and causation.

What does it mean for people to experience the supernatural? How do we understand belief in God? How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others? In this course we ask the big (and unanswerable) question why people believe in God. Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"critically evaluate primary and secondary source materials, and use both to explain social and historical phenomena."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Belief","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"517":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"45","course_id":215409,"description":"What is the origin and ultimate fate of the universe?

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"evaluate how existing social arrangements create and maintain social differences among people."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"assess and synthesize evidence about programs and interventions designed to promote diversity and inclusion."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"ccguide","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"PDCert","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"all","organization":"FEMST"}],"title":"Why So Few?

Democracy and republic are ancient names for revolutionary approaches to government of, by, and for citizens. Today, almost every state proclaims itself to be a democracy, a republic -- or both. Democratic and republican revolutions transformed ancient Greece and Rome - and later transformed the modern world. We explore how political thinkers, from Machiavelli to Madison and Mill, used the lessons of ancient politics to design bold new systems of government. Ancient politics may still hold lessons for us. We analyze what is broken in modern government (corruption, polarization, gridlock), how it broke, and how the tool kit of ancient political history might help us to analyze and repair the damage.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Viewed through the lens of medicine, the body is a text that offers clues to health and illness, yet clinical readings are never entirely objective. Culture informs and distorts how we discern, accept, reject, and analyze our bodies. Looking at literary, medical, ethical, and anthropological texts, we ask how representations of the body affects the way we experience illness, embody gender and racial identities, and understand our rights (or lack of rights) to control our own bodies.

We will address the question of allocation at the level of health policy and health economics before applying the concepts to the institutional and bedside level. Using real world examples, you will be asked to actively engage in debating controversial topics such as organ transplants and how to assign scarce ICU beds.

These are some of the questions this course will raise as it looks at how ideas of progress inform western thinking about science, history, evolution, and politics. It will engage with thinkers who argued in favor of the idea of progress as well as thinkers who attacked its presumptions. Reading and critically evaluating philosophical, scientific, and literary texts, we will investigate the different consequences of our residual belief in progress, as well as the consequences of our possible abandonment of that belief.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[],"title":"Progress: Pro and Contra","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"529":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"59","course_id":218900,"description":"We live in a world of sound. In ways that we do not always see, our social practices and machines lead us to understand certain sounds as signal and filter out others as noise. Drawing on thinking from linguistics, musicology, science and technology studies, and literature, this class challenges freshmen to become aware of their own listening practices and to learn how to listen actively and critically. We ask students to think about how listening can give them knowledge about themselves; how it relates to memory and identity; and how it is like or unlike reading. We will then introduce issues related to listening and technology: how technology influences the perception of sound; the perceived lack of fit between noise and an individual's perception of it.  Finally, we will address varies cultures of musical listening, the classical Western tradition, South Asian musical traditions, and the listening experiences of immigrant and minority communities.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Why do we bother to design beautiful things? Is it possible to design truth and conscience into technology? How do we reconcile deep uncertainties brought on by new technology, with the underlying values we hold as humans?nnWhat we make, in turn, makes us. This course examines the nature, purpose, and meaning of design in human life, seeking to understand its underlying universality as an interweaving of engineering, art, philosophy, and a radical synthesis of means-to-ends (things done for the sake of another purpose; e.g., technology) and ends-in-themselves (things valued for their intrinsic worth; e.g., truth, beauty, morality, the idea of play). It explores design as something that both embraces and confronts technology, not purely as means to yet another end, but also in its potential for humanistic meaning, understanding, and poignancy. It examines the idea that we should not always design from practical needs (as we are often taught) but also from the values underlying the needs; that technology should not be only an agent of change, survival, or happiness, but through what we do with it, also a mirror to define our own humanness.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter

course asks a question that can elicit a variety of responses. Classical music means different things to different people. For some it connotes Western art music of a particular historical era. According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free. Aesthetic interests and prejudices come into play, whether implicitly or explicitly.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30309,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday","Friday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Parna","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sengupta","middle_name":"","name":"Sengupta, P.","sunet_id":"parnas"},{"first_name":"Justin","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tackett","middle_name":"","name":"Tackett, J.","sunet_id":"tackett"}],"location":"200-105","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"05","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18955,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":9,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Parna","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sengupta","middle_name":"","name":"Sengupta, P.","sunet_id":"parnas"},{"first_name":"Kirsten","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Paige","middle_name":"","name":"Paige, K.","sunet_id":"kpaige"}],"location":"Econ 206","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18954,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":8,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday","Friday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Parna","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sengupta","middle_name":"","name":"Sengupta, P.","sunet_id":"parnas"},{"first_name":"Justin","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Tackett","middle_name":"","name":"Tackett, J.","sunet_id":"tackett"}],"location":"200-015","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18953,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":11,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"3:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Parna","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Sengupta","middle_name":"","name":"Sengupta, P.","sunet_id":"parnas"},{"first_name":"Kirsten","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Paige","middle_name":"","name":"Paige, K.","sunet_id":"kpaige"}],"location":"Encina West 106","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18880,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":38,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":120,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Hinton","middle_name":"","name":"Hinton, S.","sunet_id":"shinton"}],"location":"Campbell Recital Hall","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"THINK","tags":[],"title":"What Makes Music Classical?","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"538":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"68","course_id":221373,"description":"Genomes reveal a wealth of information with implications far beyond the linear sequence of the DNA.

We will look at examples from history and anonymized patients to highlight the consequences of these question for people. Next we will consider what the genome tells us about the future: how might it foretell our individual future and how might this be translated into patient treatment?

Isn't it better to be confident and decisive? Writing teachers and textbooks tend to reinforce this view, insisting that students present a strong thesis as soon as possible. Even if you address counterarguments and offer concessions, your argument should override if not demolish them in the end. Even if you feel deeply ambivalent about a topic during your research, your final draft must demonstrate unwavering conviction: you slam your fist and make your point. nnRecent research questions the value of unwavering conviction. For example, management scholar Christina Ting Fong notes, &quot;The results from two laboratory experiments demonstrate that individuals experiencing emotional ambivalence are better at recognizing unusual relationships between concepts, therefore showing an ability believed to be important to organizational creativity.&quot; nnWhat if, instead of sweeping your ambivalence under the rug, you tried to embrace it in your research and foreground it in your writing? Is ambivalence always a liability? What advantages can be found in the deep, risky waters of uncertainty? How do scientists, social scientists, and humanists regard ambivalence? What do ambivalent texts look and feel like? Can they move and persuade us? Is it possible to map and tap into a rhetoric of ambivalence? nnIn this course, we'll explore such questions in an attempt to understand the relationship between ambivalence and persuasion. We'll analyze and discuss the ways that writers such as Annie Dillard, Stephen Jay Gould, and Michael Pollan not only engage their ambivalence but weave it into their prose. Most importantly, we'll explore how you can develop rhetorical strategies and habits of mind to achieve results in your own analytical and persuasive writing. We'll study how to craft compelling arguments that do fuller justice to complex emotions and ideas.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30259,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Erik","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Ellis","middle_name":"","name":"Ellis, E.","sunet_id":"ellise"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":18824,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Dec 6, 2019","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Erik","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Ellis","middle_name":"","name":"Ellis, E.","sunet_id":"ellise"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Sep 23, 2019","start_time":"9:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2019-2020 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"PWR","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1:  Prowling Toward Certainty: Exploration as Argument","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"593":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"1EI","course_id":220373,"description":"Rhetorical analysis of readings, research, and argument.

Have you ever noticed that you change the way you speak to present a particular social identity? For example, have you ever switched between dialects or languages to show alignment with certain social groups or mark your 'in-group' status? Because language is flexible (and somewhat controllable), it can be used as a resource to create and index identity. However, given its flexible nature, criticizing someone's language often becomes a more socially acceptable way of attacking someone than something that seems like bald-faced racism\/sexism\/homophobia, etc.  In this course we'll explore this complex link between identity and language.nnThis course explores the way language and social identity are defined, discussed, and debated in America, and the assumptions this rhetoric presents about race, class, education and other social identities more broadly.  Together, we&iquest;ll consider: What's it like to grow up monolingual versus bilingual or multilingual? What role do our ethnicity and\/or race play in how our language skills are perceived? What role do language attitudes and stereotypes play in influencing our daily lives? What role does the media play? How is language discussed in politics? Students will be able to work on a research project related to social identity and language on a topic of their choice.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: The Rhetoric of Language and Social Identity in America","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"604":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"1IY","course_id":217354,"description":"Rhetorical and contextual analysis of readings; research; and argument.

How are they debunked? What strategies do writers use to prove the impossible, to convince the world that ghosts can exist? We will use our explorations of the supernatural to shape our ability to make nuanced arguments, to draw effectively from research materials, and to think critically about what we see and hear.

In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family?","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: It's All Relative: The Rhetoric of the Modern American Family","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2019-2020"},"663":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1 Requirement","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"1WG","course_id":210546,"description":"Rhetorical analysis of readings, research, and argument.

Despite our fascination with extreme acts of violence, those who study the nature of illegality know the opposite to be true: Far from a problem of murder, crime is instead predominantly composed of everyday acts of offense that never garner police attention, such as tax evasion, the violation of environmental regulations, computer hacking, and recreational drug use. Critical criminologists term this kind of unprosecuted crime &quot;crime's dark figure&quot; because it flies below the radar of public awareness and judicial action.

We start by writing an analytical essay about multimedia reporting, move into writing about research regarding a topic of your choice, and close by sharing research in oral presentations.

In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story. Students in this course will have a special opportunity to meet personally with poet Billy Collins and singer Aimee Mann when they visit campus in April. Does not fulfill NSC requirement. For students who have completed the first level of the writing requirement and want further work in developing writing abilities, especially within discipline-specific contexts and nonfiction genres. Individual conferences with instructor and peer workshops. Prerequisite: first level of the writing requirement or equivalent transfer credit.

In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent.

Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
