We will also take up the great debate on whether a liberal education or vocational training is the surest path to advancement.&nbsp; We will engage this debate through the works of W.E.B.

Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2018-2019"},"3":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

Socrates and other ancient thinkers examined themselves and found that they did not match up to their own ideals.  They thus set out to transform themselves to achieve a good and happy life.  What is the good life?  How do we change ourselves to live a good and happy life?  How do literature and philosophy help us to understand ourselves and to achieve our social, ethical, and personal ideals? In this class, we examine Socrates and Augustine's lives and ideas.  Each struggled to live a good and happy life.  In each case, they urge us to transform ourselves into better human beings.  The first half of the course focuses on the Athenian Socrates, who was put to death because he rejected traditional Greek ideals and and proclaimed a new kind of ethical goodness.  The second half focuses on the North African Augustine, an unhappy soul who became a new man by converting to Christianity.  These thinkers addressed questions and problems that we still confront today:  What do we consider to be a happy life?  Do we need to be good and ethical people to live happily?  Is there one correct set of values?  How do we accommodate other people's beliefs?  Is it possible to experience a transformation of the self?

For the Greeks, tragic plays offered the truth about life's calamities and horrors.  The Greeks enjoyed these plays because the dramatic artistry made beauty out of horror and suffering.  The Greeks did not believe that they controlled their fates.  The Greeks had a &quot;tragic wisdom&quot; that enabled them to confront the hardships of life and the inevitability of death.

In ITALIC 91 we ask:  How do artists innovate?  What roles can earlier artworks play in new creations?  How do audiences create? In addressing these questions, we will read texts by Viktor Shklovsky, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Susan Sontag, among others. We will attend Tosca at the San Francisco Opera, the Susan Meiselas exhibition at SFMoMA, as well as street art and the home of the conceptual artist David Ireland in the Mission District of San Francisco.

In conjunction with a specially-commissioned artwork by Mark Dion at the Cantor Arts Center, we will consider how contemporary artists are re-interpreting museum collections and think of curation as a form of art-making.

This year-long program fosters close exchanges among faculty, students and guest artists and scholars in class, over meals and during excursions to arts events. We trace the challenges that works of art have presented to categories of knowledge--history, politics, culture, science, medicine, law--by turning reality upside-down or inside-out, or just by altering one's perspective on the world. The arts become a model for engaging with problem-solving: uncertainty and ambiguity confront art makers and viewers all the time; artworks are experiments that work by different sets of rules. Students will begin to understand and use the arts to create new frameworks for exploring our (and others') experience.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28883,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":16,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in Burbank Library.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Dec 7, 2018","end_time":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 24, 2018","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Autumn","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30759,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in Burbank Library.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2019","end_time":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2019","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":30356,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Class meets in Burbank Library.","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2019","end_time":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Alexander","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Greenhough","middle_name":"","name":"Greenhough, A.","sunet_id":"awgreen"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 7, 2019","start_time":"4:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"ITALIC","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture, Writing Section","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"30":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"99","course_id":219835,"description":"Student-led courses in the arts.

Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Titanic, Batman - all are deeply informed by ancient myth, folklore, and oral traditions.  One reason is that the deep stories of myth and folklore act as a bridge between our personal lives and the profoundest aspects of the human condition. They offer a way to understand our lives and how to live them.n nThis course offers an in-depth study and experience of myth and folklore, the roots of modern story and the roots of our own stories.  You will hear these myths live, as people have for thousands of years&iquest;from Trickster folk tales to the medieval Arthurian grail epic Parzival.  You will also draw from these epics to create and tell a mythic story of your own. This will give you an appreciation for myth as a living principle, not just something from a long time ago. It will also help you become a good storyteller by developing your memory, improvisation, and image-based thinking. This ability to tell a story well is at the root of authentic leadership and helps us bring a powerful, embodied perspective to championing a cause or just debating over coffee.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":34197,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":16,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":20,"max_waitlist_size":10,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2019","end_time":"9:00:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Jonah","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Willihnganz","middle_name":"Gabriel","name":"Willihnganz, J.","sunet_id":"jonahw"},{"first_name":"Martin","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Shaw","middle_name":"James Peter","name":"Shaw, M.","sunet_id":"martin71"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2019","start_time":"6:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"ORALCOMM","tags":[],"title":"The Mythic Life (LIFE 175)","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2018-2019"},"43":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"177","course_id":202143,"description":"Speech as action has long been seen as essential to leadership.

Since the inception of the motion picture, the urban landscape and its inhabitants have served as a rich and diverse palette for filmmakers. This course will provide an overview of documentary, experimental, and hybrid films that proffer an unexpected and sometimes disturbing perspective on cities, both here and abroad. We will examine films that privilege artistic expression and expand the conventions of the film form, analyzing how filmmakers distill an issue, situation, or environment through a particular formal style and point-of-view.nnThrough a consideration of iconic historic films, the student will gain a rich understanding of how cities have inspired filmmakers who work outside the traditional fiction genre. In addition to written assignments, students will distill their own experience of the city through photo essays that explore the eclectic geographic, social, and cultural life of New York.

What can neuroscience say about what makes us human? How can we ask questions about the brain that are observable, testable, and answerable? The human brain is the most complex organ we know. To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world. You will learn both how the science of the brain has emerged through understanding important experiments and observations and how you can formulate and test your own experimental questions about the brain.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SMA"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-SMA","description":"1.

failed to accomplish?  How did Americans reimagine the United States as a nation after the war?  Who belonged in the national community and who would be excluded? In 1865, the peace treaty was signed at Appomattox and the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but the battle over memory and national identity had just begun.  The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today.  We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music.  Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories? And in what ways?  The stories we choose to tell about the past can shape not only our understanding of the present, but also the kind of future we imagine and strive to realize.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter

How can natural and social sciences, humanities, and technology fields interact to contribute to their solution? How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations? The term sustainability seems to be everywhere.  Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SMA"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-SMA","description":"assess and synthesize scientific evidence, concepts, theories, and experimental data relating to the natural or physical world."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"energy","organization":"PIE"},{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"energy","organization":"IEARTH"},{"name":"food","organization":"IEARTH"},{"name":"eenr","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Sustainability Challenges and Transitions","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"490":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"43","course_id":215407,"description":"Is love a spiritual or a bodily phenomenon?

We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender.

What does it mean for people to experience the supernatural? How do we understand belief in God? How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others? In this course we ask the big (and unanswerable) question why people believe in God. Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"critically evaluate primary and secondary source materials, and use both to explain social and historical phenomena."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Belief","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"492":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"45","course_id":215409,"description":"What is the origin and ultimate fate of the universe?

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"evaluate how existing social arrangements create and maintain social differences among people."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"assess and synthesize evidence about programs and interventions designed to promote diversity and inclusion."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"use and evaluate either qualitative evidence or quantitative data in social inquiry."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"learn what makes a question about human behavior or the behavior of social institutions and structures empirically tractable and significant, and thereby become a capable consumer of research."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"apply the methods of research and inquiry from social science to the study of human behavior in social, political, and economic organizations."},{"code":"WAY-SI","description":"analyze the effects of one or more kinds of social institutions and social structures on human action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"ccguide","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"PDCert","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"all","organization":"FEMST"}],"title":"Why So Few?

Democracy and republic are ancient names for revolutionary approaches to government of, by, and for citizens. Today, almost every state proclaims itself to be a democracy, a republic -- or both. Democratic and republican revolutions transformed ancient Greece and Rome - and later transformed the modern world. We explore how political thinkers, from Machiavelli to Madison and Mill, used the lessons of ancient politics to design bold new systems of government. Ancient politics may still hold lessons for us. We analyze what is broken in modern government (corruption, polarization, gridlock), how it broke, and how the tool kit of ancient political history might help us to analyze and repair the damage.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter

The course will culminate with a one-week creative workshop on the question of empathy.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-CE","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"engage in artistic collaboration and the creative reinterpretation of art made by others."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"experience what it is to make the unimagined possible and real."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"explore their own potential to produce original creative projects."},{"code":"WAY-CE","description":"take creative risks beyond their comfort zones."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"explore power relationships within social, racial, gendered and cultural contexts and how those relationships have changed over time."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"assess and synthesize evidence about programs and interventions designed to promote diversity and inclusion."},{"code":"WAY-ED","description":"manipulate challenges that surface in interactions between people with different backgrounds, worldviews, environmental opportunities, and how social contexts exacerbate or reduce these challenges."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"THINK","tags":[{"name":"introsem","organization":"RELIGST"},{"name":"religst","organization":"RELIGST"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Empathy","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"498":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"}],"code":"51","course_id":216658,"description":"This course provides an overview of the challenges and aspirations facing ideals of democracy.

We will address the question of allocation at the level of health policy and health economics before applying the concepts to the institutional and bedside level. Using real world examples, you will be asked to actively engage in debating controversial topics such as organ transplants and how to assign scarce ICU beds.

Drawing on thinking from linguistics, musicology, science and technology studies, and literature, this class challenges freshmen to become aware of their own listening practices and to learn how to listen actively and critically. We ask students to think about how listening can give them knowledge about themselves; how it relates to memory and identity; and how it is like or unlike reading. We will then introduce issues related to listening and technology: how technology influences the perception of sound; the perceived lack of fit between noise and an individual's perception of it.  Finally, we will address varies cultures of musical listening, the classical Western tradition, South Asian musical traditions, and the listening experiences of immigrant and minority

How do we reconcile deep uncertainties brought on by new technology, with the underlying values we hold as humans?nnWhat we make, in turn, makes us. This course examines the nature, purpose, and meaning of design in human life, seeking to understand its underlying universality as an interweaving of engineering, art, philosophy, and a radical synthesis of means-to-ends (things done for the sake of another purpose; e.g., technology) and ends-in-themselves (things valued for their intrinsic worth; e.g., truth, beauty, morality, the idea of play). It explores design as something that both embraces and confronts technology, not purely as means to yet another end, but also in its potential for humanistic meaning, understanding, and poignancy. It examines the idea that we should not always design from practical needs (as we are often taught) but also from the values underlying the needs; that technology should not be only an agent of change, survival, or happiness, but through what we do with it, also a mirror to define our own humanness.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Classical music means different things to different people. For some it connotes Western art music of a particular historical era. According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free.

You'll move far beyond the five-paragraph essay to explore the many rhetorical possibilities available to college writers. We'll not only examine conventions of academic writing but will also explore how scholars across the disciplines challenge the stereotype that academic writing must be dull and stuffy. In fact, good academic writing engages readers and communicates complex ideas clearly. This course will help you not only persuade your audience but also captivate and perhaps even entertain readers. As Professor Helen Sword notes in her book Stylish Academic Writing, \"academic writing is a process of making intelligent choices, not of following rigid rules.\" In this course you'll learn to make your own intelligent choices as you write a rhetorical analysis of a local commercial space, as you select and research a topic related to consumer culture, and as you write a persuasive essay on that topic.

They will also learn how to revise their short essays for more clarity, coherence, and flow as well as how to construct a longer research essay. In the past, students have written essays on a wide variety of topics such as Latino, African American, and transnational identities, Asian parenting, inter-racial dating, stereotypes in Hollywood films, and minorities in technology and science.nnnThere will be many in-class activities including oral reports, and students will have a chance to revise their essays after peer editing sessions. Towards the end of the class, students will also learn how to put together and deliver a PowerPoint presentation based on their research, the same way professionals do.

Isn't it better to be confident and decisive? Writing teachers and textbooks tend to reinforce this view, insisting that students present a strong thesis as soon as possible. Even if you address counterarguments and offer concessions, your argument should override if not demolish them in the end. Even if you feel deeply ambivalent about a topic during your research, your final draft must demonstrate unwavering conviction: you slam your fist and make your point. nnRecent research questions the value of unwavering conviction. For example, management scholar Christina Ting Fong notes, &quot;The results from two laboratory experiments demonstrate that individuals experiencing emotional ambivalence are better at recognizing unusual relationships between concepts, therefore showing an ability believed to be important to organizational creativity.&quot; nnWhat if, instead of sweeping your ambivalence under the rug, you tried to embrace it in your research and foreground it in your writing? Is ambivalence always a liability? What advantages can be found in the deep, risky waters of uncertainty? How do scientists, social scientists, and humanists regard ambivalence? What do ambivalent texts look and feel like? Can they move and persuade us? Is it possible to map and tap into a rhetoric of ambivalence? nnIn this course, we'll explore such questions in an attempt to understand the relationship between ambivalence and persuasion. We'll analyze and discuss the ways that writers such as Annie Dillard, Stephen Jay Gould, and Michael Pollan not only engage their ambivalence but weave it into their prose. Most importantly, we'll explore how you can develop rhetorical strategies and habits of mind to achieve results in your own analytical and persuasive writing. We'll study how to craft compelling arguments that do fuller justice to complex emotions and ideas.","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":29205,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Dec 7, 2018","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Erik","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Ellis","middle_name":"","name":"Ellis, E.","sunet_id":"ellise"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Sep 24, 2018","start_time":"9:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"PWR","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1:  Prowling Toward Certainty: Exploration as Argument","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"551":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"1EI","course_id":220373,"description":"Rhetorical analysis of readings, research, and argument.

Have you ever noticed that you change the way you speak to present a particular social identity? For example, have you ever switched between dialects or languages to show alignment with certain social groups or mark your 'in-group' status? Because language is flexible (and somewhat controllable), it can be used as a resource to create and index identity. However, given its flexible nature, criticizing someone's language often becomes a more socially acceptable way of attacking someone than something that seems like bald-faced racism\/sexism\/homophobia, etc.  In this course we'll explore this complex link between identity and language.nnThis course explores the way language and social identity are defined, discussed, and debated in America, and the assumptions this rhetoric presents about race, class, education and other social identities more broadly.  Together, we&iquest;ll consider: What's it like to grow up monolingual versus bilingual or multilingual? What role do our ethnicity and\/or race play in how our language skills are perceived? What role do language attitudes and stereotypes play in influencing our daily lives? What role does the media play? How is language discussed in politics?

In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family?","final_exam":false,"gers":["Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Writing & Rhetoric 1: It's All Relative: The Rhetoric of the Modern American Family","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"654":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"not given this year","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"NOTTHIS"}],"code":"1VS","course_id":212214,"description":"Rhetorical and contextual analysis of readings; research; and argument.

In this way, our class will draw on the rhetoric of architecture to illuminate the rhetoric of communication; we will do this under the premise that understanding the one can lead to a better understanding and practice of the other.

Social media have greatly enlivened and democratized science communication so that it now moves between scientists and various audiences. Scientific content is no longer static, nor is it merely for advanced researchers. Scientists using social media are learning to assess content collaboratively to help provide better science in public communication. One of the particular obligations of university science students is to join the conversation, help review and revise content in the public sphere. Students in this course will actively engage in the evolving world of science communication and practice their scientific writing, research and oral presentation skills.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story.

For example, we will analyze key theories about the relation of institutions, doctors, and patients, from Foucault's Birth of the Clinic to Rita Charon's Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness. We will also investigate how patients make sense of their illnesses through art and memoirs, how doctors are trained in an empathetic bedside manner, and the rhetoric of medical breakthroughs. From this foundation, students will choose an issue to tackle in their own research projects, from the politicization of Planned Parenthood and women's healthcare, to the experience of trans patients seeking care, to the rhetoric of access vs. coverage in current debates about health insurance.

After all, European modernism began with the encounter of the New World, and Europe&iquest;s own identity was forged in the process of &iquest;Latinization&iquest; of the Western Hemisphere. In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent. This course introduces students to primary decolonial rhetorical texts and asks students to apply these insights to pressing contemporary challenges by practicing deep reading of primary and secondary texts, preparing group presentations, and exploring creative acts of composition with an eye toward imagining brave new worlds and the decolonial rhetorical practices valued therein.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":30949,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2019","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Cassie","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Wright","middle_name":"","name":"Wright, C.","sunet_id":"cassiew"}],"location":"160-326","start_date":"Jan 7, 2019","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2018-2019 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Brave New Worlds: An Introduction to (De)colonial Rhetorics","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2018-2019"},"815":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Ethical Reasoning (ER)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"ER"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Social Inquiry (SI)","name":"WAYS","schedule_print":true,"value":"SI"}],"code":"194DH","course_id":217417,"description":"Does not fulfill NSC requirement.

But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
