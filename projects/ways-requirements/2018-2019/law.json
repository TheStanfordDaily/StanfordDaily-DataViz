If a student seeks to continue or expand on work that the student initiated previously (whether for a course, clinic, externship, or otherwise) a student must (1) share the initial work with the professor supervising the directed research, to the extent that work is non-privileged, and (2) obtain permission for the expansion from the instructor or supervisor who supervised the initial project.  The final product must be embodied in a paper or other form of written work involving a substantial independent effort on the part of the student.  A student must submit a detailed petition of at least 250 words, approved by the sponsoring faculty member, outlining his or her proposed project and demonstrating that the research is likely to result in a significant scholarly contribution.  A student may petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development&quot; when the work involves assisting a Law School faculty member in developing concepts or materials for new and innovative law school courses. Both the supervising faculty member and the Associate Dean for Curriculum must approve petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development.&quot; Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance.

Directed professional writing credit is designed to allow a student, or a small group of students working together, to receive academic credit for their work tackling real-world problems.  Only projects supervised by a member of the faculty (tenured, tenure-track, senior lecturer, or professor from practice) may qualify for Directed Professional Writing credit.  It will not necessarily be appropriate to require each member of the team to write the number of pages that would be required for an individual directed research project earning the number of units that each team member will earn for the team project.  The page length guidelines applicable to individual papers may be considered in determining the appropriate page length, but the faculty supervisor has discretion to make the final page-length determination.  Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance. Unit credit is by arrangement.  A petition will not be approved for work assigned or performed in a course, clinic, or externship for which the student has or will receive credit.  See Directed Professional Writing under Curricular Options in the SLS Student Handbook for requirements and limitations.

The laissez faire thinking of the 19th century was replaced by Keynesian management in response to the Great Depression. After WWII, Keynesian thinking was challenged by what has come to be called &quot;neoliberalism&quot;---a challenge that began to achieve success in the 1970s in response to perceived failures of government, high inflation, and other economic and social woes. By the mid-1980s, neoliberalism had become the new conventional wisdom, and liberals as well as conservatives accepted its core premises: that society consists of atomized individuals competing rationally to advance their own interests; that this behavior, in aggregate, produces good social outcomes and the greatest economic growth; that free markets are therefore the best way to allocate societal resources and government should intervene only to remedy market failures. Disagreements about what constitutes such failures and when and how to correct them persisted, but the general premises were widely embraced by policymakers and politicians (reflected, for example, in the so-called Washington Consensus). Today, this consensus is breaking down. Neoliberal policies have contributed to generating profound wealth inequality and have little to offer to address the perceived negative consequences of globalization and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. But what should come next? Our readings in the course will explore a variety of themes related to these debates. How did neoliberalism come to dominate political discourse? What are its core tenets? What kinds of challenges are being presented to them, and what might an alternative approach to political economy for the 21st century look like? Winter Quarter.

Because many innovations have characteristics of public goods, state intervention is necessary to prevent underinvestment---although the optimal form of intervention is far from clear. In practice, governments incentivize innovation and allocate access to knowledge goods through a variety of mechanisms, including intellectual property, direct funding through grants and national laboratories, tax incentives, and innovation inducement prizes. In this discussion group, we will examine how these bodies of law are used to both reinforce and subvert existing power structures and inequalities, including issues related to gender, race, geography, and income.

Topics will include the role of lawyers in responding to the Trump immigration policies, from providing crisis advice at airports in winter 2017 through contemporary controversies about family separation; the role of lawyers opposing and supporting Trump on television and in social media; the professional dilemma for progressive lawyers in the federal government about whether to stay or leave; and substantive legal issues that have arisen since Trump took office, such as questions about whether the President can be indicted, the emoluments clause and the 25th Amendment.  Begin in Autumn Quarter and run through Spring Quarter. Class will meet five Tuesdays from 7:00 - 9:00 p.m. (precise dates TBD).  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation.

and Private Sector.  Today, the international community faces increasingly complex security challenges arising from transnational criminal activities. Effective international cooperation among national police agencies is critical in combatting cross-boundary criminal threats like terrorism, human and drug trafficking, and cybercrime. INTERPO---the world's largest international police organization---has aggressively worked to counter criminal networks across the globe by facilitating international police cooperation through global information sharing via its criminal databases. To conduct cross-border investigations and tackle organized crime, the law enforcement agencies around the globe can instantly access millions of records on fingerprints, DNA, stolen motor vehicles, firearms, and travel documents stored in INTERPOL's databases. Only the designated law enforcement agencies from INTERPOL's member countries are authorized to share and add information to these databases.  Advances in digital technologies and proliferation of communication platforms have created new challenges for the law enforcement. Criminal actors increasingly use private corporate entities, like Internet Service Providers, other telecommunications entities, and social media platforms, to coordinate criminal activities, such as trafficking in persons, terrorism, or cybercrime.  Those private sector actors also are potentially critical repositories of information about criminal activity, including communications about members of criminal networks and financial information. Effective law enforcement operations accordingly often depend on information exchange with private sector. Law enforcement authorities face difficulty in effectively accessing, analyzing, and utilizing information from private sector actors in third countries. INTERPOL strives to innovate to adequately respond to the evolving threat landscape and remain at the forefront of global policing efforts. Therefore, it is committed to reviewing and improving its policies on collecting, handling, and sharing data from private sector sources, particularly sources in the technology industry.  Under the supervision of the faculty, students in this practicum will work with INTERPOL to enhance its role in cooperating with private sector actors to better fight cyber-crime, terrorism, and other forms of transnational crime. Students will conduct comparative analysis on how select INTERPOL member countries and other relevant international law enforcement agencies exchange information with private sector while safeguarding privacy and protecting civil liberties. Based on this in-depth comparative research, the team will then propose a policy guidance for INTERPOL on information exchange with private sector.  This practicum takes place for two quarters (Fall and Winter). Although students may enroll for either one or both quarters, preference is given to students who agree to enroll for both quarters. Students will work directly with INTERPOL clients (via video-conferencing and email) and may have opportunities to travel to INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon over the Spring Break for meetings with clients to develop our policy guidance and provide policy briefings. Selected students in the practicum may also have the opportunity to pursue internships and\/or externships at the Office of Legal Affairs, INTERPOL General Secretariat in Lyon, France and\/or at INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore.  This Practicum is open to students from the Law School (both JDs\/LLMs\/JSMs\/JSDs), the Graduate School of Business, International Policy Studies, the School of Communications, the Computer Science Department, and other graduate students outside of the SLS. Practicum will meet weekly on Wednesdays, from 9:00-10:30 am and hold regular discussion sessions with senior INTERPOL officials via VCT.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class participation, Written Assignments, Oral Briefings, Final Paper. NOTE: Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee. Such approval will be granted only for good cause shown. Even in the case of a successful petition for additional units, a student cannot receive a letter grade for more than eight units of independent research (Policy Lab practicum, Directed Research, Senior Thesis, and\/or Research Track). Any units taken in excess of eight will be graded on a mandatory pass basis. For detailed information, see &quot;Directed Research\/Policy Labs&quot; in the SLS Student Handbook.

This class is the third and final installment of Winter and Spring 2018 classes on Community-Led System Design. It builds on the research and on-site court user data conducted by the previous student teams, and incorporates feedback from our court partner client, to develop final policy recommendations on court innovation models. This concluding practicum will produce a report advising the California Judicial Council on how it can: (1) expand user testing of its services and new self-help technology; (2) establish policy lab partnerships with universities and other outside bodies; and (3) increase its internal capacity for civic innovation.  The research team will survey models of government living labs, policy labs, user testing groups, and other partnerships with universities. They will assess possible models and case studies for the court to consider, and will gather feedback from the client partner about the court's needs and constraints. The class will build on the research and case studies generated in the Winter and Spring 2018 practicums to formalize findings into a full policy proposal report and client briefing.  The practicum concludes in two parts: (1) a formal presentation to the partner client and other legal services and court stakeholders about innovation models the courts could adopt and (2) an interactive workshop in which stakeholders give feedback and join the practicum team in developing strategies to operationalize recommendations.

This Policy Lab will focus on how child welfare agencies in Sonoma County can develop policies that best meet the needs of children and youth who need to be placed in foster care. Specifically, the Lab will provide these agencies with guidance on implementing a new California statute, AB 403, which made significant changes to the rules governing foster care placement in California. AB 403 requires counties to preference placement in foster family homes rather than group homes, institute heightened provider accountability, and provide wrap-around services for youth in foster care.  In California, over 60,000 children are in foster care as a result of child abuse or neglect or juvenile delinquency, with a majority remaining in the foster care system for at least a year. In Sonoma County, between 50 and 75 children require foster care placement each day. The nature and quality of the placement is critical to protecting the well-being of these children.  Working closely with the Policy Lab client, the Sonoma County Juvenile Justice Commission, the research team will assess the major provisions of AB 403 and its federal counterpart (the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018), examine how Sonoma County is serving youth in the wake of AB 403 implementation, and develop guidelines that county agencies can use in choosing the best placement alternative for each child. Activities will include summarizing the intention and requirements of AB 403; examining the county's progress in responding to the law; analyzing relevant data on placement decisions; identifying gaps in services, policies and procedures; developing a toolkit of resources and practices for county administrators and other providers and stakeholders; and formulating policy recommendations to ensure both implementation with the law and best practices for serving youth. In addition to legal and other research, students will interview relevant stakeholders. The policy lab will culminate with an oral presentation to the Juvenile Justice Commission.  Students wishing to undertake R credit will perform additional research for a white paper analyzing the issues and results of the collective research. R credit is possible only by consent of the instructor. After the term begins, and with the consent of the instructor, students accepted into the course may transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

When a person must go to court to deal with a divorce, eviction, or credit card debt, or myriad other actions, the justice system can be difficult to navigate without professional help. It's even more challenging for those who are not proficient in English. In recognition of California's linguistic diversity -- with over 200 languages spoken -- the courts have made 'language access' a priority for innovation.  This policy practicum works closely with California state courts to research, design, and test new strategies for making courts accessible to all people, regardless of language or cultural background. The research team works directly with court staff, users, and other stakeholders to create new tech-based and human-centered services that can reduce barriers to the justice system.  Students will gain experience in design research, prototyping new technologies on-site at court, and building strategies for innovation in the government.  As courts decide which technologies and programs best support access, this design research project serves as a lab to test, refine, and advise the California Judicial Council on effective means to improve access to the courts for diverse linguistic populations. The final deliverables include an evaluation of existing language access technologies based on user testing and on-site evaluations, a proposal of a fuller pilot, and policy recommendations for how courts can prioritize language and cultural inclusion in their innovation investments.  Pre-requisites: We strongly encourage applicants with language skills in Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Farsi, and beyond.  Much of our work will involve working with people with limited English proficiency, and different language skills will be highly valued.

Although much of the media attention surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) tends to focus on the advances being made in industry, major breakthroughs in the field often begin at the university level. Stanford is among the global leaders in this regard. All across campus, teams led by preeminent researchers are deploying projects that apply cutting-edge AI systems to complex and highly challenging social, technical and policy problems. Stanford has pioneered projects ranging from systems aimed at improving palliative care outcomes, to those aimed at improving the ethical decision-making of autonomous vehicles, to those that shape critical decisions in the criminal justice system. Yet the successful deployment of these projects in the real-world is deeply intertwined with questions of regulation and legal liability that push existing doctrinal boundaries---from IP to health regulation to due process and civil rights---to their limits.  This policy lab seeks to engage with some of the most challenging legal questions and opportunities presented by these emerging technologies. We will work closely with some of Stanford's leading research teams to help them navigate the murky---oftentimes uncharted---legal, regulatory, ethical, and policy waters surrounding the deployment of novel AI applications. In doing so, we will provide extensive legal research support, collaboratively strategize and design deployments, help innovators evaluate and pilot new applications, and ultimately expand access to transformative technologies for populations in serious need. Students will work primarily with clients from Stanford departments at the forefront of studying, developing and deploying AI systems: (1) the Computer Science Department's Stanford Machine Learning Group, led by Andrew Ng (https:\/\/stanfordmlgroup.github.io\/); (2) the Mechanical Engineering Department's Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, led by Chris Gerdes and Stephen Zoepf (https:\/\/cars.stanford.edu\/); and (3) the Management, Science, and Engineering Department's Computational Policy Lab, led by Sharad Goel (https:\/\/policylab.stanford.edu\/).  We seek to build a collaborative team of diverse backgrounds and skill sets to learn from each other and enhance the overall capacity of the research. We encourage students who are interested in tech policy, entrepreneurship, AI, access to justice, and social impact to join us, including upper-division and graduate students from Law, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, MS&amp;E, Public Policy, and the social sciences.  Students interested in this policy lab should submit a consent form with a resume and statement of interest to be reviewed by Professor Malone.

This policy lab will explore the growing role that artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are playing in the federal administrative state. Already, a wide range of federal agencies are utilizing software that uses machine learning and related techniques associated with AI to make and support decisions. Examples include efforts by the Social Security Administration to improve decisional quality in the adjudication of benefits claims, by the EPA to model the toxicity of chemical compounds, and by the IRS to predict tax non-compliance and identify audit targets. Other uses of AI are in the pipeline or already in place but remain outside public view. Such use will almost certainly increase as AI becomes more sophisticated and cheaper and as the private sector's increasing reliance on AI to make decisions presses agencies to keep pace in order to regulate effectively. As agency use of AI proliferates, administrators, lawyers, and judges will have to ask how well agency deployment of machine learning systems conforms to well-established principles of constitutional and administrative law. Students enrolled in this policy lab will have a unique opportunity to help set the terms of that debate via a first-of-its-kind report to be submitted to the Administrative Conference of the United States (linked here), an independent federal agency charged with recommending improvements to administrative process and procedure. Students will spearhead completion of a report designed to explore the use of AI in the administrative state at multiple levels. The first part of the project will be a mapping exercise, with descriptive and predictive components. The chief descriptive task will be to canvass the hundreds of agencies that make up the federal administrative state and document agency use of AI across a wide range of substantive policy areas. A related, more predictive part of the project will draw on Stanford University's distinctive concentration of technical knowledge in AI and related fields to assess where AI may be most likely to be deployed by agencies in the near- and medium-term. The final part of the project will turn to normative issues, by contributing to a framework for thinking about the many legal, policy-analytic, and philosophical questions raised by agency use of AI to perform regulatory tasks. To the extent possible, we will consider how agency use of AI may affect the administrative state in general terms, and will explore some of the implications of core administrative law doctrines --- such as the nondelegation doctrine, arbitrary and capricious review, due process, and rules governing reliance on subordinates for decisions --- for agency use of AI. Students enrolled in the lab will work in teams, with each allocated a cluster of agencies. As the project unfolds, teams will drill down on practices, both actual and predicted, in specific agencies that exemplify the legal and normative tensions that will arise as agencies increasingly deploy AI technologies. Students will be encouraged to deploy a range of methodologies, including careful secondary and legal research, case studies, survey work, and stakeholder interviews, among others. Some of this work may also require travel to Washington, D.C. or agency regional offices in order to fully understand agency practices or, upon the project's completion, to present findings. The policy lab is open to all students at Stanford University, and will ideally attract both law students and also non-law students from technical fields who can contribute a sophisticated understanding of the current trajectory of AI technology. For law students, past coursework or a strong background or interest in administrative law is highly recommended. Students from all parts of the University who wish to enroll in the policy lab may also consider taking Justice Cu&eacute;llar's fall quarter course at the Law School, &quot;Regulating Artificial Intelligence.&quot; Law students wishing to undertake R credit will perform additional research or take on additional tasks analyzing the issues and results of the collective research. R credit is possible only by consent of the instructor. After the term begins, and with the consent of the instructor, students accepted into the course may transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. NOTE: Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee.

This Policy Lab practicum examines Stanford University's speech policies and make recommendations, as necessary, for revisions. The research addresses: (1) changing legal requirements, including California's Leonard Law and recent First Amendment cases, (2) the need to protect students and other members of the Stanford community from abusive speech, (3) the best practices of other universities, (4) the need on the part of students and administrators alike for greater clarity and transparency, and (5) the statements by President Tessier-Lavigne and Provost Persis Drell on the importance of both freedom of speech and civility and inclusion on the Stanford campus.  Working with the Stanford General Counsel's Office as a policy client, the research team will develop an advisory report on policies and rules regarding:  (1) posting of controversial materials in various locations on campus (2) invitation of outside speakers (3) direct targeting of abusive speech against students and other community members (4) disruption of the speech of others (5) speech, including posting of materials on campus, by persons with no connection to Stanford (6) procedures for expeditious resolution of conflicts involving speech (7) counseling and other non-punitive measures (8) funding of controversial student activities (9) measures to protect the ability of vulnerable minorities to associate and speak freely on matters of common concern  Graduate students from Law, Public Policy, and social science disciplines are encouraged to apply.  Special Instructions:  This policy practicum will stretch across two quarters, winter and spring of 2019.  Students must enroll for both quarters, unless they have special permission of the instructor. Students may take the course for a total of up to three credits, which -- with notice to the instructor -- may be allocated between the two quarters as the student wishes. If, with the instructor's permission, a student is enrolled only in one quarter, he or she may take the one-quarter course for up to two credits.  The default grading system is MP (mandatory pass). Students may, however, enroll in a separate section (02), which will require a paper in addition to the practicum, and will be graded on an HP basis. Please consult with the instructor about the nature and topic of this paper.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

Hydropower is viewed today as both a major climate solution and serious conservation challenge. Among climate advocates, hydropower is critical to meeting domestic and international carbon reduction goals. Conservationists, in contrast, point to the damage caused by tens of thousands of North American dams to water quality, aquatic habitat, and a range of species. Meanwhile, there is accelerating interest in two related areas: first, looking to hydropower dams to &quot;firm up&quot; intermittent solar and wind and provide new electricity storage capacity, and second, removing obsolete dams that are harming ecosystems and impeding recreation.  There are also multiple new technologies and techniques that may help increase hydropower output and efficiency at existing dams and also enable greater compatibility of hydropower with competing resource needs like watershed management and recreation.  The research team will work closely with the clients on key issues and opportunities facing hydropower today including: developing better criteria, methodology and policy for determining which of the 80,000 powered and non-powered U.S. dams should be upgraded and which should be removed; increasing public funding and private capital -- and related policy instruments and investment vehicles -- for both repowering and decommissioning U.S. dams; analyzing the changing economics of U.S. hydropower and the influence of electricity markets and federal and state regulation; improving the operation of hydropower dams and &quot;pumped storage&quot; facilities, and related regulation, to advance the integration of U.S. wind and solar power; and reviewing state dam liability laws and their impact on decision-making about dam upgrades and decommissioning. The project seeks a diverse team of students from law, business, engineering, public policy, economics, environmental science, and earth systems, including those engaged in the Stanford Big Earth Water Hackathon (https:\/\/bigearthhacks.stanford.edu\/).  R credit: Law students wishing to undertake R credit will perform additional research for a full report analyzing the issues and results of the collective research. R credit is possible only by consent of the instructor. After the term begins, and with the consent of the instructor, students accepted into the course may transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

Stanford and other research universities have recently increased their scrutiny of research and financial transactions with domestic and foreign entities, particularly those that pose potential risks related to Export Controls or information security, or that raise concerns under federal regulations and university policies and practices, including the High-Risk Entities Protocol and the Memorandum on Foreign Influence posted on DoResearch.  Stanford University's Vice Provost and Dean of Research has asked the Law and Policy Lab to examine the University's research policies relevant to these concerns, and, where appropriate, recommend policy changes. The questions raised, which pertain not only to Stanford but to all U.S. research universities, involve openness in research, academic freedom, the publication of research results, conflicts of interest, the reporting of gifts and grants, and the exchange of people and ideas with domestic and foreign collaborators to advance the frontiers of science.

In recent years, social media platforms have faced public scrutiny for their practices in managing controversial content. New technologies are emerging that will make it increasingly more challenging for platforms to link content to its owners or determine its authenticity. Yet, legislative responses to force social media companies to better moderate their content are fraught with challenges where one-size solutions may not fit all situations. Social media companies, thus, are now seeking approaches that protect freedom of expression on their platforms while helping to forestall violations that may result in legal repercussions or government policy responses. They seek to offer individual users access to remedies to address content removal without violating the protection of individual freedoms.  Investigating possible solutions, the practicum research team will work closely with scholars at the Stanford Project on Democracy and the Internet and in consultation with senior staff at Facebook to propose the structure and procedures for an external social media oversight board (in effect, an appellate court) for platforms' decisions to take down or leave up controversial content. A motivating case will be Facebook's attempts to create an independent appellate tribunal, and senior staff at Facebook will be available to engage on the project. Issues include the board's selection and membership, and its processes, including how cases are selected for review, deliberated, and decided, and how decisions are published to provide guidance for a social media platform and its users.  Student researchers will conduct interviews with social media personnel about the challenges they face in moderating controversial content and review possible adjudication models and processes. Students who have completed First Amendment Law and\/or who have recent experience working at social media companies are especially invited to apply. The practicum meets as a discussion seminar weekly on Thursdays, 9-11 AM.

There are currently over 1200 agency positions that are supposed to be filled through the presidential nomination and Senate confirmation process; these jobs are known as PAS positions. But there are staggering &quot;vacancies&quot; in these positions--at the start of every administration but also at other times, including in the final months (and years) of a president's tenure. Many of these &quot;vacant&quot; positions can be filled temporarily. Namely, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 provides for temporary leadership primarily in executive agencies. The Act specifies who can serve in an acting capacity, for how long, and in what positions. Actions taken by an official not serving in accordance with the Act generally cannot take effect, unless Congress enacts legislation. After the time limits (which can vary by timing in the administration and nomination status) established by the Act have passed, however, agencies can often continue to function through delegations of authority (mostly &quot;down&quot; to lower level officials but sometimes &quot;up&quot; to the agency leader).  This policy lab will focus on current federal agency practices in the face of vacancies in top positions. Professor O'Connell has been selected by the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency dedicated to improving regulatory and administrative processes in government through consensus-driven applied research, to lead a study and draft agency recommendations. These recommendations will be deliberated and voted on first by an ACUS committee and, if approved, then by the ACUS's full membership in the fall. Past ACUS studies and recommendations on other topics are available here: https:\/\/www.acus.gov\/research-projects.  This policy lab will focus on several issues:  1.  Prevalence of Acting Officials - To date, there has been no systematic investigation of acting officials. Using data from the Government Accountability Office on vacancies and acting officials for the past two completed administrations and the first two years of the current administration, we will provide an empirical portrait of acting leaders--by agency, position, and time in an administration. For some agencies, we will try to classify the acting officials as either careerists or political appointees. (Professor O'Connell has already done much of the background work.).  2.  Agency Practices -  Using case studies conducted by students in the policy lab, we will examine how agencies operate when confronted with vacancies in positions that must be filled by PAS leaders. Specifically, through news searches, a survey, and agency interviews, we will seek information on the following topics for a number of agencies: whether and how an agency fills vacant PAS positions (including the development and modification of succession plans and the use of senior careerists); whether and how it uses delegation of authority within the agency; whether and how it tracks the Vacancies Acts time limits and use of relevant titles; other practices it employs when top positions are empty; and how it uses the Office of Legal Counsel's guidance on the Act.  3.  Recommendations - Based on the first two items, we will then identify best practices and craft recommendations for agencies.  Students will work in teams, with each team allocated a cluster of agencies. The teams will investigate the prevalence of acting officials (and delegated authority) in their agencies. In addition, the teams will analyze survey responses on agency practices and will conduct interviews with senior officials in their agencies. Students will be doing careful primary and secondary factual investigation work, analyzing GAO and other agency data (including from a survey of agencies), and interacting with agency officials. Some of this work may require travel to Washington, D.C. to better understand agency practices.  This policy lab is open to all J.D. students at the law school. Having taken Administrative Law is desired but not necessary. If you are interested in enrolling in this policy lab, please email amjoc@law.stanford.edu a brief statement of interest and your resume.  Students wishing to undertake R credit will perform additional research for a full report analyzing the issues and results of the team research. R credit is possible only by consent of the instructor. After the term begins, and with the consent of the instructor, students accepted into the course may transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  NOTE: Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee. Such approval will be granted only for good cause shown. Even in the case of a successful petition for additional units, a student cannot receive a letter grade for more than eight units of independent research (Policy Lab practicum, Directed Research, Senior Thesis, and\/or Research Track). Any units taken in excess of eight will be graded on a mandatory pass basis. For detailed information, see &quot;Directed Research\/Policy Labs&quot; in the SLS Student Handbook.

Measured by loss-of-life, opiate-related overdose is the most acute national health crisis of our lifetimes.  Student researchers will work closely with the client, Broken No More, a national organization of parents and families who have lost family members to opioid use. The organization supports grieving members and also pushes forward evidence-based, public health interventions to the opioid epidemic.  This practicum explores legal approaches to a more comprehensive and thoughtful understanding to the Opioid Epidemic. The research team will evaluate whether various stakeholders have fulfilled their legal and regulatory obligations to respond to the epidemic, including whether hospitals and insurers fulfill their implied &quot;duty of care.&quot;  The questions addressed in this practicum could have life-saving impact on people currently suffering from opioid use disorder.

Students wishing to enroll in an externship must meet various requirements that are set out in the Handbook. Students participating in the Civil SEP must also concurrently enroll in the Externship Companion Seminar (Law 881).

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend four or five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Based in East Palo Alto, the CLC provides students with the opportunity to provide direct legal services to low-income residents, while thinking critically about the role of lawyers and lawyering in addressing the problems of America's so-called &quot;working poor.&quot;  The Clinic's practice is in four areas: (1) housing (eviction defense and Section 8 termination); (2) wage and hour and related workers' rights; (3) social security and disability benefits; and (4) criminal record expungement. Each student handles his or her own caseload, which is comprised of cases matters in all of the practice areas. The practice areas are selected and designed to lie at the intersection where the community's unmet legal needs and students' learning needs correspond.  The clinic's docket is fundamentally a trial docket. Students have first-chair responsibility for their cases, and perform all of the lawyering tasks necessary to advance their clients' interests, including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact investigation, legal research, and representation in the court and agency settings that hear the clients' cases. Skills emphasized include those trial lawyering skills, as well as time management and developing client-centered lawyering practices. Students may also have the chance to participate in outreach or policy-level projects, such as representing the clinic on a state or regional committee on a substantive issue, doing community education workshops at sites around the Peninsula, and\/or legislative research and advocacy.  In the clinic seminar and in regular supervision, students are encouraged to interrogate the effectiveness of the legal system at delivering &quot;justice&quot; for their clients and to explore creative ways that legal knowledge can be deployed to attack the social problems attendant to low wages, substandard and unstable housing, and other features of low-income life in Silicon Valley.  Special Instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend four or five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with prosecutors, drafting and arguing motions, and occasionally trying cases before judges and juries. Common charges include drug use and possession, assault, theft, and vandalism. While students have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all work is closely supervised. The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced, and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias in the legal system, immigration consequences, economic disparities, and addiction. The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. The Clinic's broader goal is to provide lawyering skills and habits of mind transferrable to any student's chosen field of practice. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need.

Students are California Bar Certified and thus appear in court and argue cases with faculty standing by. Students take the lead role in all aspects of case development, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, developing case strategy, negotiating with prosecutors, drafting and arguing motions, and occasionally trying cases before judges and juries. Common charges include drug use and possession, assault, theft, and vandalism. While students have primary responsibility for all aspects of their cases, all work is closely supervised. The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced, and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias in the legal system, immigration consequences, economic disparities, and addiction. The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. The Clinic's broader goal is to provide lawyering skills and habits of mind transferrable to any student's chosen field of practice. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and conduct evidentiary motions, preliminary hearings, and occasional nonjury trials. The cases concern thefts, burglaries, assaults, weapons possession, drunk driving, and a range of other crimes. Students offer testimony by police officers, crime victims, and other witnesses and cross-examine defense witnesses, including those defendants who take the stand. Clinic students spend at least four full days a week -- Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays -- at the D.A.'s office or in court. There generally will be two class sessions each week: a three-hour on-campus class on Wednesday mornings and a Tuesday lunch seminar at the D.A.'s office. Toward the beginning of our term, classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument. Toward the end of the term our classroom focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice. Topics include the impact of race, gender, and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers. Students typically tour the Santa Clara County crime lab, Solano State Prison, FCI-Dublin (a federal women&iquest;s prison), and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system. Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings. During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor. Evidence is a prerequisite. Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged. Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework. Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy. Class attendance is mandatory. Grading is on the H\/P system. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses: All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered fulltime for twelve credits. This format allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without having to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams, and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic may not enroll in any other class, seminar, directed research, or other credit-yielding activity within the Law School or University during their clinical quarter. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a daytime class regularly. There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved case by case. The clinical quarter begins on the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from onsite and faculty supervisors. Students are expected to be available by email or cell phone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work. In some weeks casework may demand longer hours. Enrollment in a clinic is binding: Once a student has applied to and been selected by a clinic, the student may not drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (fulltime or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school careers.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and\/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases. The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases. The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: Attendance and participation in class, case and project work and writing assignments.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.

This course examines the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development, as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Increasingly, human rights as a framework has become essential to a broad range of situations of tension and conflict. This course interrogates the nature of engagement by human rights practitioners, as well as approaches adopted by those focused on the management of violent conflict. What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? The course also develops advocacy skills through in-class sessions, role play exercises and engagement in, and critical assessment of clinical projects in human rights.  Class sessions introduce students to human rights advocacy and conflict management techniques through discussion of the readings and related issues, as well as through student presentations critiquing their participation in supervised clinical projects. The readings and seminar sessions expose students to some of the practical manifestations of the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights and conflict resolution movement(s). These include several of the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing fact-finding and advocacy and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. The readings also consider tensions within the field of conflict resolution, as well as between conflict resolution and human rights.  Several class sessions will focus on fact-finding and advocacy skills. One or more of these sessions will be full-day, role play exercises. In these full-day sessions, students will engage in human rights research, documentation, negotiation and dispute management exercises, and advocacy role-playing.  In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical 'rounds'. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.  During the course of the quarter, students will also be required to draft several brief fact-finding\/advocacy pieces (these will be explained in class), and write short, critical reflection papers (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words, thought pieces) on the readings.  Special Instructions: - - General Structure of Clinical Courses.  The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation, written assignments. For clinic: professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking and commitment.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31475,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":7,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":12,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.  A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic. - - Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units.

Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Students in the clinic will help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, legislators, regulatory bodies, and other policy makers. Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other &quot;best practices&quot; documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.  A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic. - - Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units.

We&iquest;re designed for both students interested in M&amp;A, capital markets, emerging company, tech transactions or other corporate work, and those wanting to explore a non-litigation, advisory-oriented practice. No prior experience in business or corporate law is necessary. Our goal is to help students get a sense of corporate work and what it takes to do great work, to get practice doing it, and to see how a thoughtful lawyer can help people in meaningful ways.  Our client engagements provide students with opportunities to assess facts; develop legal and business advice; read and write contracts, corporate governance materials, and client communications; lead meetings and calls with clients; collaborate with colleagues; and receive extensive feedback about their work. Students are exposed to different practice areas, different dimensions of the work, and different perspectives on practice.  Students represent multiple clients during the term. Our clients are all established nonprofit corporations. Most generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $100 million, and some are larger. We like these clients because they have meaningful governance arrangements, audited financial statements, complex programs, valuable brands and other intellectual property, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the our contact is almost always the CEO, board chair, general counsel or other senior executive. The engagements also provide students with useful preparation for future pro bono service or membership on nonprofit boards of directors.  The course includes a class that generally meets twice a week. Class meetings center on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management. The curriculum reflects an effort to prepare students for their summer or first year in a major law firm.  Course design and operation reflect the instructors' combined 40+ years of corporate practice representing consumer products, finance, technology, and life science companies, in both law firm and senior in-house roles.  Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: The syllabus includes specific expectations and criteria relating to methodical analysis, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and crisp execution, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31440,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

We&iquest;re designed for both students interested in M&amp;A, capital markets, emerging company, tech transactions or other corporate work, and those wanting to explore a non-litigation, advisory-oriented practice. No prior experience in business or corporate law is necessary. Our goal is to help students get a sense of corporate work and what it takes to do great work, to get practice doing it, and to see how a thoughtful lawyer can help people in meaningful ways.  Our client engagements provide students with opportunities to assess facts; develop legal and business advice; read and write contracts, corporate governance materials, and client communications; lead meetings and calls with clients; collaborate with colleagues; and receive extensive feedback about their work. Students are exposed to different practice areas, different dimensions of the work, and different perspectives on practice.  Students represent multiple clients during the term. Our clients are all established nonprofit corporations. Most generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $100 million, and some are larger. We like these clients because they have meaningful governance arrangements, audited financial statements, complex programs, valuable brands and other intellectual property, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the our contact is almost always the CEO, board chair, general counsel or other senior executive. The engagements also provide students with useful preparation for future pro bono service or membership on nonprofit boards of directors.  The course includes a class that generally meets twice a week. Class meetings center on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management. The curriculum reflects an effort to prepare students for their summer or first year in a major law firm.  Course design and operation reflect the instructors' combined 40+ years of corporate practice representing consumer products, finance, technology, and life science companies, in both law firm and senior in-house roles.  Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: The syllabus includes specific expectations and criteria relating to methodical analysis, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and crisp execution, applicable across client and seminar work.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31442,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":10,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise.

The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.  For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H\/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Written work, editing of other student's written work, attendance, class and moot court participation.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"PW-Professional Writing Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"PROFWRTING"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31371,"component":"CLN","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":9,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students.

All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with coalitions and\/or other education-sector agencies to advance equity-minded educational policies and school reform. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students. Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaborations with non-profit clients.

Yet despite the common attributes of the corporation familiar to every U.S. law student, corporations around the world have diverse ownership structures, interact in their domestic political economies in different ways, and exhibit a host of traits that vary with the institutional context in which they operate. This seminar explores the many forms corporate capitalism takes around the world, the forces that shape domestic corporate law and governance in major countries, and the important legal and policy issues raised by global corporate activity. We will explore the rise of &quot;agency capitalism&quot; in the U.S. and the proliferation of new forms of corporate ownership around the world, the emergence of Chinese state capitalism and its legal and policy consequences, efforts to reform Japanese stakeholder-oriented capitalism, and the emergence of hybrid forms of business organization designed to pursue both profits and social benefits. Policy issues to be considered include the &quot;social responsibility&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; of the corporation, the national security implications of foreign investment by state-owned enterprises, and the consequences of global hedge fund activism.

Advanced Corporate Finance introduces these topics by lecture and then explores them through detailed analysis of actual cases. This structure maximizes the synergy between theory and practice, providing students with portable, durable, and marketable tools for their careers. Legal considerations that arise in the execution of these corporate financial decisions include mandatory disclosure requirements, the issuance of dual class shares, charges of anticompetitive practices, taxes, appraisal cases and fairness opinions, takeover defenses and fiduciary duty challenges, contractual provisions in merger agreements, insider trading, and Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This class rigorously advances both conceptual and practical\/analytical understanding. The knowledge gained will facilitate professional dealings with boards of directors, chief executive officers and chief financial officers, investment bankers, consultants, portfolio and investment managers, venture capitalists, and private equity investors.

The course extends over two quarters. In the Fall quarter it will meet four hours per week. In the Winter quarter, it will meet ONLY FOR FIVE WEEKS for four hours per week--for 2 units of course credit. During those five weeks, it will meet on Monday and Friday. Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Fall quarter. Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Most of the materials consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures use to respond to underlying economic challenges. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals that we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more. Special Instructions: Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. Students who have not taken the course in the fall cannot register for it in the winter, and those who took it in the fall must register for it in the winter. No exam in Autumn Term. An In-School exam will be given at the conclusion of the course in the Winter Term. Grades will be given at the end of the second quarter and will be applied to both quarters. I use the consent form to ensure diversity of experience and non-experience and diversity across classes. There is no background required for the course.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, class presentation, written assignments, group paper, and exam.

In order to register for this course you must have taken Deals I; and if you took Deals I, you must register for Deals II.  Deals I and II apply economic concepts to the practice of structuring contracts. The course extends over two quarters. Deals I will meet four hours per week. Deals II will meet ONLY FOR FIVE WEEKS for four hours per week--for 2 units of course credit. During those five weeks, it will meet on most Fridays, as scheduled.  There will be some weeks in which I schedule a class earlier in the week, during a free period, and cancel a later Friday class.  Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during Deals I. Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of Deals I will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Most of the materials consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures use to respond to underlying economic challenges. In Deals II, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals that we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more. Special Instructions: Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. Students who have not taken Deals I cannot register for Deals II, and those who took Deals I must register for Deals II. No exam at the end of Deals I. An In-School exam will be given at the conclusion of Deals II. Grades will be given at the end of Deals II and will be applied to both quarters.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the &quot;final cut&quot; and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations. The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

No prior knowledge of finance will be assumed. If you want an introduction to corporate finance and won't take the full 3 credit course, this is for you. The first part of the course (approximately 6 weeks) will consist of on-line modules and problem sets that you will complete on your own and in small groups. We will cover topics such as: earnings, cash flows, income statements, interest rates, time value of money, estimating firm value, risk and return and the cost of capital. We will provide a framework for answering questions such as: how much is this project (or firm) worth? How should the firm raise money for a new investment? There will be weekly problem sets and you will get experience with building a simple model (excel spreadsheet) that will help you estimate the value of a potential new project. The second part of the course will consist of in-class discussions of case studies that apply these valuation principles to particular legal settings: e.g. valuing settlement offers, merger proposals, appraisal proceedings, and the efficient capital markets hypothesis.

Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe.  &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront:  --What does it mean for a company to &quot;do good&quot;? Should it care?  --When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns?  --What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives?  We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground.

The class operates along two concurrent paths:  First, under faculty supervision, students will act as if they were outside counsel to a Stanford-affiliated startup, learning the business and personal goals of the founder(s) and spotting  the relevant legal and non-legal issues.  Students will use formal analytical frameworks, including legal research, business strategy, policy strategy, and design thinking, to craft a comprehensive review of the startup's position within the applicable regulatory and business environment, and will present their strategy recommendations to the founder(s) and a panel of faculty and outside experts.  Second, students will engage in a case-based exploration of complex legal, regulatory, and ethical issues that often occur in early stage companies.  Through focused case studies, students will be required to spot issues, analyze potential outcomes, and make defensible recommendations for legal and business strategy. Issues covered will include corporate formation and capitalization, entering regulated marketplaces, supply chain ethics, employment and culture, and multi-jurisdictional scaling.

We will begin with the role of venture capital in the broader US economy, who the players are in the ecosystem and how venture capital funds are raised and managed. We will then have a series of modules through which we'll understand how venture capitalists structure deals (including a full understanding of the economic and governance issues associated with a term sheet).  We will dive into the role of the board post-investment, with a particular emphasis on the fiduciary duties (often conflicting) of the board in governing a venture capital financed business. In particular, we will look at the role of the board in financing activities, M&amp;A activities and various special situations. The course will utilize case law as well as various articles and case studies to articulate the potential governance issues boards may encounter.

America has adopted an array of increasingly tough approaches to crime, including aggressive street-level policing, longer sentences, and a range of collateral consequences for criminal convictions.  As a result, there are currently 2.2 million persons in prisons and jails and seven million under some form of correctional supervision.  The impact on communities of color has been especially profound: In many of our nation's cities, nearly one-half of young black men are in the criminal justice system.  This seminar will begin with readings discussing the tough-on-crime era's historical roots. We will then turn to examine the impact of these policies. Finally, we will turn to current efforts to resist and reform the system that has been created. This portion of the seminar will focus on violent crime, and whether and how to respond to violent crime differently than we currently do.  The assigned reading will be substantial, and will come from a wide variety of sources, including history, sociology, political science, criminology, and law.

In many ways, the era of mass incarceration began in California with the enactment of the &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot; law in 1994. Today, California leads political and policy trends in the opposite direction. In this seminar students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing policies and assist with related ongoing research, public policy analysis and advocacy, and live litigation on behalf of inmates sentenced to life in prison for nonviolent crimes. The class focuses largely on California's Three Strikes law as a case study in the history, politics, constitutional doctrine, and reform of criminal justice policy throughout the country. Students will test their skills in the field by assisting with the representation of individual inmates sentenced to long prison terms for nonviolent crimes in state and federal courts. The Project has been intimately involved in the movement to reduce incarceration in California and throughout the country, partnering with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Obama administration on different projects including direct legislative reform, impact litigation, executive clemency, and prisoner reentry. Students enrolled in the seminar quickly become involved in all aspects of the Project's work, including assistance with different stages of ongoing litigation. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigations, and draft petitions on our clients&iquest; behalf. The Project is an active, fast-paced organization that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in this seminar. This seminar offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law and to hone practical litigation and advocacy skills in and out of the courtroom. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week, including 1 hour individual meetings with Project director Mike Romano. CONSENT APPLICATION: Interested students must apply to enroll in the seminar by sending a one-page statement of interest and resume by email with the subject line &quot;application&quot; to Mike Romano (mromano@stanford.edu).

Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable. The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore: (1) sentencing theories and their application; (2) the nature, scope and function of jails, prisons, probation and parole; (3) the impact of incarceration on crime, communities, and racial justice; (4) the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs; (5) the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction; (6) special prison populations (e.g., mentally ill) and policies (e.g., solitary confinement); (7) prison litigation and conditions of confinement; and (8) parole, risk prediction, and prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates. Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School.

This Seminar will focus on some causes, preventions and potential remedies for this phenomenon. Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted. As we study these subjects, we will also reflect on whether taking some reforms too far will impair on the efficacy of legitimate law enforcement. The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants). During each of these additional sessions, students will watch a film involving a wrongful conviction and will engage in conversation about the particular case involved.

What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing &quot;big picture,&quot; synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather than just working within the doctrinal and institutional structures that exist at present. For students interested in legal academia, this course will develop your ability to read sophisticated theoretical material, to write in the same vein, and to relate theoretical ideas to policy prescriptions.

Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create &quot;legislative courts&quot; outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

Very quickly, the cases are consolidated in the federal court in Northern California. Meanwhile, special purpose foundations are established in the Netherlands to seek a settlement with VW on behalf of European consumers under the Dutch collective settlement act, and a securities lawsuit on behalf of investors whose share values have dropped dramatically is filed in Germany, using that country's special group litigation procedure. The Dutch foundations may be coordinating their actions with US lawyers, the shareholders in Germany are represented by the local partners of a leading US-based litigation boutique, and the shareholder suit is funded by a UK-based international litigation financing firm. In 2011, US-based Apple sues Korea-based Samsung for patent infringement in N.D. CA and Samsung counter-sues in Korea, Japan and Germany. A year later more than 50 lawsuits are ongoing in more than 10 countries. Two years later the companies agree to drop their litigation outside the US and focus their resources on their US litigation battle. Apple wins a big judgment in the federal court in San Jose but Samsung appeals all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. SCOTUS rejects the appeal and remands and in Spring 2018 the case is on the calendar for the third time (!) in San Jose. Philip Morris' Hong Kong subsidiary files a claim in an international arbitration tribunal charging that Australia's public health protection statute regarding tobacco marketing violates Australia's bi-lateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The arbitration claim is filed after the parent company unsuccessfully challenged Australia's statute before the High Court. In December 2015 the arbitration tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction over Philip Morris' claim effectively dismissing it. But controversy over Philip Morris' and other multi-national corporations' attempts to use investment arbitration to challenge diverse health, safety and environmental protection regulations derails international trade negotiations and leads to efforts to establish an international court for investment disputes. These high-profile cases illustrate an important aspect of complex litigation: across many different substantive domains, in court and ADR proceedings, disputes that used to be contained within national borders are now trans-national. The seminar will consider the doctrinal, procedural and practical challenges that arise when litigation goes global. We will consider the high profile cases in which these issues have played out in recent years and meet some of the lawyers who are creating a new virtual international court system for the resolution of global disputes. The goal of the seminar is to develop an understanding of how the global dimension of high-stakes complex disputes shapes parties' and lawyers' strategies and judges' decisions. The seminar will meet 3 times a week. A small number of seminar sessions will be conducted in collaboration with law faculty and students in Canada, the Netherlands and Germany, three countries that have adopted procedures for dealing with large-scale civil litigation in distinctive fashions.

The U.S. energy system today is subject to a complex regime of state and federal laws. We will examine the historical role of state-level electric utility regulation, tracing its evolution into the various forms of regulated and deregulated energy markets now in use in the U.S. electricity and natural gas sectors. Contemporary energy law increasingly involves a delicate federalist balance where state and federal regulators share overlapping authority in contested policy areas that are subject to major technological and economic change, as changes in the supply and costs of renewable and fossil energy resources alike transform the U.S. energy sector. Finally, we will interrogate the contested ideals of regulation and competition, which private, non-profit, and governmental stakeholders all deploy in legal and political fora to advance private gain and public goods--most recently in a series of transformative proposals to use federal emergency powers to provide financial bailouts to legacy fossil and nuclear power plants. Students who complete the class will gain a historical understanding of how economic regulation of the energy sector has evolved since the early 20th century, a durable conceptual framework for understanding modern energy law and policy debates, and a practical understanding of energy law designed for future practitioners. Non-law students interested in energy issues are highly encouraged to take this course, as energy law literacy is essential to careers in the sector.

We will focus on the key federal environmental statutes, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, and the leading cases in which these statutes have been interpreted by courts. The statutes will be studied in some detail so that students emerge with a basic understanding of their major regulatory provisions. Thematically, the statutes serve as illustrations of different regulatory approaches to environmental problems, from command and control standards to market-based instruments. In addition, we will discuss important matters of policy, including the Obama administration's efforts to address climate change through the use of Executive Power, and the Trump administration's efforts to rescind these policies. The course will also cover developments in constitutional law which significantly affect federal environmental law; and will cover the role of cost-benefit analysis in environmental regulation. Finally, we will discuss the political economy of environmental regulation, specifically the role played by interest groups (both industry and environmental organizations) in producing, implementing and enforcing environmental law.  Students need not be self-identified &quot;&quot;environmentalists&quot;&quot; to be interested in this course. Nearly every area of law is now affected by environmental regulation, including private law fields such as real estate, bankruptcy and corporations.

In many cases, private companies have made important contributions to meeting water needs (e.g., in the development of new technologies and expanding water supplies).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established or emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues that they generate. These businesses include investor-owned water utilities, water technology companies (e.g., companies investing in new desalination or water recycling technologies), water-right funds (who directly buy and sell water rights), social impact funds, innovative agricultural operations, water concessionaires, and infrastructure construction companies and investors. Each week will focus on a different business and company. Company executives will attend the class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and\/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers during the course of the quarter on businesses that present to the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion on the class on either a water company of the student's choice or a policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).

This course will be essentially the same as in the past four years (when it was cross-listed as GSB GEN 335).  This course is highly multi-disciplinary, both in terms of substance and student mix. The course has consistently had a significant mix of business, engineering, law and earth science students.  As in the past, the course will focus on the issues associated with the business of developing, financing, constructing and operating grid-scale clean energy projects.  The course will focus on what a project developer or lender (i.e., in either case, the business person) needs to know to develop and finance successful projects.  The project development business--far more than many other businesses such as tech, manufacturing, consumer, services, retail or transportation--inherently involves a VERY long list of highly-germane and critical legal issues.  We address the legal issues from the perspective of what a business person needs to understand in order to navigate them and complete a project.  The primary course materials will be documents from several representative projects -- e.g., solar, wind, storage, carbon capture, transmission, combined heat &amp; power -- covering key areas including market and feasibility studies, environmental permitting and regulatory decisions, financial disclosure from bank and bond transactions, and construction, input, and offtake contracts. For virtually every clean energy project, legal documents and financial\/business models tend to highly customized. By examining actual projects and transactions we can learn how developers, financiers, and lawyers work to get deals over the finish line--deals that meet the demands of the market, the requirements of the law, and (sometimes) broader societal goals, in particular climate change, economic competitiveness, and energy security.

Based on scholarly analysis and guest speakers, this interdisciplinary course will frame the arc of climate past, present and future on the pillars of politics, finance and infrastructure. Starting with the policy framework established by past global climate negotiations, the bulk of the course will investigate current innovations at the intersection of finance and policy, including risk metrics, management and disclosure, liability litigation, blended finance, new investment vehicles and intermediaries, and resilience measures. The final sessions will consider the future, taking a look at how future leaders might solve the greatest challenge of our time.

In addition to these four seminar sessions, there will be an introductory California Water 101 session for students and a closing session on what we have learned.  Students will be assigned readings and required to develop questions for discussion.  Lead instructor for the seminar will be Landreth Visiting Fellow Dr. Timothy Quinn.  Dr. Quinn spent more than ten years as the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, and more than twenty years as the Deputy General Manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.  Over the course of that career, he was at the center of every major water management issue facing the state of California, including the state's use of Colorado River water, management of the Bay Delta, and sustainable groundwater management.

The course investigates these issues as they operate in a range of specific contexts in public health, including the control and prevention of infectious disease; preventing obesity; reducing tobacco use; ensuring access to medical care; reducing firearm injuries; and responding to public health emergencies. In these contexts, we will ask and answer questions such as, what do the Constitution and key statutes permit? What makes a good public health law? Where do we see success stories---and failures---in public health law?

Scientists have developed new biologic drugs to cure cancer, complex algorithms to identify public health risks or predict disease, and 3D-printed medical devices. Biomedical research is also tremendously expensive. In this seminar we will examine the economics of biomedical R&amp;D and the legal framework that is designed to incentivize new advances, with an emphasis on pharmaceuticals. We will consider policy tools including patents and other intellectual property, FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity, prizes, grants, tax incentives, and insurance reimbursement. We will also discuss how these incentives are funded and what this means for allocating access to medical technologies, both in the United States and abroad. The current policy mix of innovation incentives and access allocation mechanisms is far from perfect, and students will have the opportunity to discuss reform proposals with real-world biomedical innovators from different sectors. There are no prerequisites, and no technical or economic background is required, but students should be willing to learn about biomedical technologies, detailed legal frameworks, and economic policies.

Whether it is interviewing a potential new client, interrogating a witness in a deposition, or conducting a direct or cross examination at trial, knowing how to ask a question is an essential lawyering skill. We'll explore textual materials and real life case examples in transcripts, videotape, and cinema to determine the principals and best practices for questioning. We'll learn how to prepare for questioning, how to focus, narrow, and broaden an examination, how to obtain key admissions, how to deal with a difficult opponent, when to stop asking, and how to use what's been obtained in court or otherwise to win for your clients. This course will give you the skills and tools needed for the critical roles of understanding your clients and your cases and successfully representing their causes.  Class attendance is required.

Correlatively, what are the economic and ethical dimensions of risk classifications and management? How serious are the concerns about moral hazard and adverse selection---core concepts of insurance law? What standards should be used to resolve insurance bad faith claims?  And, when a party is sued and the liability insurer controls the party's defense, how should the defense lawyer hired by the insurer navigate---and conceive of---this triangular relationship? The pervasive role of insurance in addressing societal concerns about accidental harm is vitally important but has been remarkably under-examined in the traditional law school curriculum.

Constitutional, civil and economic rights have been created, such as marriage equality and strict liability in tort, but rights have also been limited through statutory restrictions and other means. The role of the judge has grown to activist and administrator in cases such as prison reform and housing desegregation. And through it all, it has been lawyers who have fought, won, and lost the battles of expansion and contraction of rights and remedies. Where the government fails to protect us, private practitioners serve a crucial role in challenging the legal &quot;status quo&quot; through civil litigation; vindication of a particular client's claim can simultaneously establish or clarify the rights in question on a societal scale.  Taught by an experienced trial lawyer, along with guests from both plaintiff and defense practices, course readings and discussion will draw on a wealth of textual, law review, and lay media, and the arc of relevant case law, including real trial experiences and litigation documents. This course explores changes in motor vehicle and commercial product safety, medical malpractice, police misconduct, civil rights, marital rights, sexual harassment and abuse, firearms liability, school and housing desegregation, college hazing, privacy, school funding and consumer safety. We'll study the titanic struggle over appropriate remedies for wrongs in these substantive areas, ranging from immunity to limits on recoveries, compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. We'll also study how a plaintiff or defense lawyer can make a difference for their clients and others similarly situated to catalyze significant societal improvement. Elements used in grading: The grade is based on class work (i.e., contribution to discussions and participation in class exercises) and a final paper. There is no exam.

The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art-and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded? We anticipate having two or three visitors to the class during the quarter, such as a gallery owner, auctioneer, and museum director.

This course aims both to increase students' understanding of rhetoric as readers and interpreters of legal texts and to develop students' skills as writers and speakers.

But what kind of knowledge does a smartphone or dashboard camera video offer? We tend to treat certain kinds of video as unmediated representations of reality, even though as sophisticated consumers of media we should know better. Neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect. But the desire that drives it--the desire for definitive proof of what did or did not happen--arises from very real experience, and is inextricably connected to the legal process. This seminar tracks the legal reception of modern visual representation from confusion about the admissibility of photographs in the late 19th century (is it like a drawing? is it like eyewitness testimony?) to the debate about cameras in the courtroom in the late 20th century (do judges and jurors decide differently when the proceedings are subject to public scrutiny?) to the frequent and strategic deployment of visual media in pretrial and litigation practice today. We will also explore the prominent role of video in today's conversation about policing and race. Course materials range from judicial opinions to film theory to social psychology to presentations by practicing attorneys.

This course will respond to this gap by building a bridge between law and the arts, with the goal of helping students hone their ability to think creatively and use disciplined imagination. Law &amp; Creativity will meet twice a week and have dual components designed to inform one another. The first session will be structured as a seminar in which students gather to examine and discuss creative treatments of legal and professional issues in a variety of media (including film, fiction, and nonfiction). The second session will follow the creative-writing workshop model in which students submit their own fiction and creative nonfiction pieces for group discussion.

In the week prior to a given speaker's presentation, the class will meet as a group to discuss secondary literature relevant to understanding and critiquing the speaker's research. Students will then read the speaker's paper in advance of the following week's workshop presentation.  Students have two options. Those taking the course for 2 units are required to write a brief response to each speaker's paper. There will be a total of four speakers, and thus four papers. Guidance will be provided concerning how to frame these response papers, which will be due every two weeks - i.e., on the day before the speaker presents. Students taking the course for 3 units are required to write a research paper on a law and humanities topic that they choose (in consultation with the professors).

Within the last decade there has, however, been an explosion of energy in the field, which has expanded beyond the boundaries of the literary text narrowly conceived and incorporated a range of other genres and humanistic approaches. Several recent or forthcoming books survey the range of emerging scholarship and the potential for new directions within the field.  Using one of these--New Directions in Law and Literature (Oxford, 2017)--as a guide, this course will delve into a variety of topics that law and literature approaches can illuminate. These include, among others, conceptions of sovereignty and non-sovereign collectivities, the construction of the citizen and refugee, competing visions of marriage and its alternatives, law and the rhetorical tradition, and theoretical perspectives on intellectual property. Nearly every session will pair recent scholarship in the field with a literary or artistic work, ranging from Claudia Rankine's Citizen to Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 3 or 4 units, depending on the paper length.

We'll focus of the tension between law and justice, perhaps peeking forward to Melville's Billy Budd, and MLK Jr.'s Letter from the Birmingham Jail.  We will continue with the third play in Aeschylus' Oresteia, focusing on the decision to remit Orestes to the judgment of the people of Athens, rather than to the Furies, in connection with the murder of Clytemnestra. We'll focus on the decision to vest secular authorities with the definition of justice.  We'll close with a reading of Antigone, focusing on the relationship between the individual and the state, and the gendered nature of justice.

Television entertains, delivers the news, and provides an important forum for debating political issues. Focusing on communications law and first amendment law, the course will discuss how and why regulation shapes what we see on TV, and how it attempts to ensure that television can fulfill its functions for society. For example, why is cable television so expensive? Why can comedians swear on cable TV, but not on broadcast TV? Should regulators care as much about violence as they do about indecency? Can we trust the market to give the audience what it wants? Will the market provide content that is in the public interest, such as local news or educational programming, or do  regulators need to intervene?  Should we care if media outlets are increasingly owned by a few small conglomerates? And how does the Internet affect the need for ownership regulation?

Network neutrality rules are based on a simple principle: Internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast that connect us to the Internet should not control what happens on the Internet. Net neutrality rules prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down websites, making some sites more attractive than others, or charging sites fees to reach people faster.  After a long, public fight that mobilized more than 4 million people across the political spectrum, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted strong net neutrality rules in February 2015. Now these rules might be on the chopping block. FCC Chairman Pai, who opposed the rules when they were adopted, has declared his intention to roll back the rules, while expressing some support for &quot;net neutrality principles.&quot; At the same time, Republicans in Congress have indicated they might consider a legislative solution.  Through lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, the seminar will introduce students to the key questions underlying the net neutrality debate so that they can become informed participants in this debate. Do we need net neutrality rules, and, if yes, what should they be? What are the options for addressing net neutrality at the FCC and in Congress? How do past court decisions constrain the FCC's options for adopting net neutrality rules? While the class focuses on the net neutrality debate in the U.S., the underlying policy questions are general and directly applicable to ongoing net neutrality debates around the world.  The class is open to law students and students from other parts of the university. Students do not need to have any technical background to participate in the class; any necessary background will be taught in class.

A good legal system relies on information about the world itself (such as evidence of who did what and when) as well as more purely legal information (such as court rulings, statutes, contracts, and so forth). Legal Informatics is the theory and practice of managing such information. It covers both legal theory and information theory. It also covers elements of general information processing technology as well as applications of that technology in the administration of law. While the concept of Legal Informatics is not new, its importance is greater than ever due to recent technological advances - including progress on mechanized legal information processing, the growth of the Internet, and the proliferation of autonomous systems (such as self-driving cars and robots), as well as globalization of the legal industry. The upshot of these advances is the emergence of practical legal technology that is qualitatively superior to what has gone before. This technology is capable of dramatically changing the legal profession, improving the quality and efficiency of legal services and disrupting the way law firms do business. The technology is also capable of popularizing the law - bringing legal understanding and legal tools to everyone in society, not just legal professionals. Through this class students gain an understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities the legal system and the legal industry are facing in light of this tech-driven transformation of our legal system, and learn about innovative new approaches seeking to address them. Particular attention will be given to Computational Law, the branch of Legal Informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal analysis. Expert guest-speakers from academia and industry will provide for a diverse and interdisciplinary experience. Successful legal technology entrepreneurs and thought leaders in the legal technology space will provide a practical angle to the discussion. Class sessions include: An introduction to legal informatics; Information Retrieval and Case Search, Document Creation \/ Expert Systems; Computational Law (Legislation &amp; Regulation); Computable Contracts (Drafting and Negotiation); Unauthorized practice of law. Grading: Option 1 (section 01): Independent Research Paper (individual; 75% of grade). Students shall write an independent research paper on a legal informatics topic. You are invited to propose a topic and a working title and to discuss your topic ideas with us. The topic and the working title of the research paper must be approved by the instructors, before you start your detailed research. Independent research papers require by definition that students include other research materials besides the readings for class. Students electing option 1 will receive Research (R) credit. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the length of the research paper. If you wish to earn 2 units, the research paper shall be at least 18 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins). If you wish to earn 3 units, the research paper shall be at least 26 pages in length (double-spaced, 12-point font size, 1-inch margins). You can find examples of papers written by last year&iquest;s students on the CodeX website at https:\/\/law.stanford.edu\/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics\/codex-publications\/#slsnav-seminal-papers. Option 2 (section 02): Computational Law Lab (individual or group; 75% of grade). Students can identify a legal information problem and develop a computational law system, individually or as part of a team, to address the problem by preparing a technical demonstration project\/prototype and in form of a written report about the project. Students can build their own system using Neota Logic, (https:\/\/www.neotalogic.com\/), Stanford's Worksheets system (http:\/\/worksheets.stanford.edu) or another technology stack that is suitable to the project at hand (to be discussed with instructors). Each student can choose one of the above two options, whichever he\/she prefers. After the term begins, students electing option 2 can transfer from section (01) into section (02), with consent of the instructor. During the course, students will be asked to provide a brief description of their project. There are no prerequisites for this class.

No issue in the digital age has demonstrated this better than the history of and litigation surrounding Google Books. For over a decade, from the inception of the product to the resolution of its legal issues, lawyers were integrally involved with engineers and the business every step of the way. They helped design its features, defend it from lawsuits, craft a settlement, and advocate complementary policy positions.  On a broader level, the history of ebooks is a microcosm of the opportunities and challenges of the digital age: new technologies to reproduce and distribute works, changing consumer norms, massive disruptions to economic interests, evolving concepts of fair use, increased access to information, fears about piracy, and threats to competition. Every one of these issues requires skilled lawyering in close partnership with business leadership.  This seminar will focus on strategic lawyering at the cutting edge of innovation by closely studying, among other things, the history of Google Books and the evolution of copyright in the digital age. We will look at how leading businesses, including Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, have each used law, litigation, and policy as tools to advance their business interests. We will focus on developments related to ebooks, and also study analogous issues involving the music, movie, and newspaper industries.  The seminar will include guest speakers who have led legal strategies to further innovation. Some copyright experience is helpful but not essential. The course is open to graduate students throughout the university, especially the Graduate School of Business, the Department of Communication, and the Journalism Program.  Special Instructions: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of their position on the waitlist and degree of study.

Technical, legal and economic choices will affect whether the Internet can realize its potential or not.  Communications law - the law that governs both the physical infrastructures for communications services such as cable and telephone networks as well as the communication services which are provided over these infrastructures - has become one of the most important arenas in which choices affecting the future of the information society are made. The debates over network neutrality or the right ways to foster broadband deployment are examples of this trend.  At the same time, the Internet's ability to support a variety of different communications services such as telephony, information services or video over the same physical network infrastructure challenges the existing communications law, which is based on the assumption that different physical infrastructures offer different communications services.  What can regulators and legislators do to allow the Internet to realize its economic, social, cultural, and political potential? How can we foster the deployment of more broadband networks? And how can policymakers allow applications like Internet telephony and traditional telephony to coexist without giving one an unfair advantage over the other? The course will address how current law deals with these questions, but also explore what regulators and legislators may do to better deal with the challenges posed by the Internet. The course is mostly focused on the US, but highlights developments elsewhere where appropriate.  Special Instructions: Students may take Communications Law: Internet and Telephony and Communications Law: Broadcast and Cable Television in any order (neither is a prerequisite for the other).

The internet and digital media technologies have opened up new spaces for expression -- spaces that are designed and controlled by a handful of private companies. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and Google's algorithms determine what content is presented to us; software designed by Facebook and Twitter identifies and filters content like fake news; and new kinds of &quot;speakers&quot; like bots tweet and share information. The engineering and design choices underlying these technologies have significant implications for our ability to express ourselves and for democracy. But our expressive rights are increasingly in tension with platform companies' statutory immunities, like CDA 230, and, potentially, their constitutional claims to speech and press rights. Lawyers operating in this space -- whether from the perspective of technology companies, policymakers, regulators, or academia -- need to understand not only traditional First Amendment doctrine, but also the statutes and technologies that shape the behavior of private actors and the spaces in which expression occurs. They need to grapple with questions of responsibility and accountability, and with the proper balance between private and public control. This course prepares students to deal with the complex dynamics underlying these issues. Every other week, a scholar or practitioner at the cutting edge of these topics will present their research or discuss their professional experiences. Students will read any materials provided in advance, and the class will engage in a discussion with the guest. In the week before the speaker's presentation, we will meet as a group to discuss key literature informing the scholar's work or the practitioner's experiences. Special Instructions: Enrollment will be limited to 15 students from both SLS and H&amp;S. Experience with First Amendment doctrine is helpful, but not required. Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either five reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length.

Consequently, copyright law has far-reaching economic and cultural implications. In this seminar, we will consider the interests of some of the different groups affected by the copyright regime, including creators, technologists, audiences, institutions, and heirs. Course readings will cover copyright case law and scholarship; research on creative practices and relevant business models; the role of copyright law in innovation policy; and legal versus extralegal modes of protecting the fruits of creative labor. Throughout, we will assess the fairness, efficacy, and alignment of copyright protection and remedies available, to whom, when, and for what reasons. The course aims to deepen students' knowledge of copyright law and scholarship; to equip students to develop principled policy arguments about the scope of copyright protection; and to enable students to evaluate reforms and alternatives to copyright in light of how these might serve different entities in the copyright ecosystem.

Different industries and players have differing and often competing views of our patent system--how effective it is in promoting innovation and what, if any, reform is needed.  Students will play the role of counsel on one or more teams representing the interests of particular stakeholder groups. The teams will engage in a series of mock negotiations on actual legislative or administrative patent reform proposals with other teams, as well as mock legislative or administrative engagements before Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office respectively.  The goal is to achieve consensus on patent reforms that best serve the stakeholders' individual and collective interests, all in an environment of competing interests. Through experience-based learning and simulations, students will gain an understanding of some of the most current patent policy issues being debated in Congress and before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Today the term is widely understood to describe fast-evolving technologies (such as elaborate convolutional neural networks leveraging vast amounts of data) increasingly used in finance, transportation, health care, national security, and a variety of other fields.  This highly interactive new course surveys current and emerging legal and policy problems related to how law structures humanity's relationship to artificially-constructed intelligence.  To deepen future lawyers' understanding of current and medium-term problems in this area, the course explores definitions and foundational concepts associated with &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; likely directions in which AI will evolve, and different types of legally-relevant concerns raised by those developments and by the use of existing versions of AI.  We will consider distinct settings where regulation of AI is emerging as a challenge or topic of interest, including autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapons, AI in social media\/communications platforms, and systemic AI safety problems; doctrines and legal provisions relevant to the development, control, and deployment of AI such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation; the connection between the legal treatment of manufactured intelligence and related bodies of existing law, such as administrative law, torts, constitutional principles, criminal justice, and international law; and new legal arrangements that could affect the development and use of AI.  Cross-cutting themes will include: how law affects the way important societal decisions are justified, the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings, the incorporation of multiple values into AI decisionmaking frameworks, the interplay of norms and formal law, and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change (such as environmental protection, aviation, and the food economy).  Note:  The course is designed both for students who want a survey of the field and lack any technical knowledge, as well as for students who want to gain tools and ideas to deepen their existing interest or background in the topic. Students with longer-term interest in or experience with the subject are welcome to do a more technically-oriented paper or project in connection with this class.  But technical knowledge or familiarity with AI is not a prerequisite, as various optional readings and some in-class material will help provide necessary background.  Requirements: The course will involves a mix of lectures, in-class activities, and student-led discussion and presentations.  Requirements include attendance, participation in planning and conducting at least one student-led group presentation or discussion, two short 3-5 pp. response papers for other class sessions, and either an exam or a 25-30 pp. research paper.

Industries as far flung as finance, transportation, defense, and healthcare invest billions in the field. Patent filings for robotics and machine learning applications have surged. And policymakers are beginning to grapple with technologies once confined to the realm of computer science, such as predictive analytics and neural networks. AI's rise to prominence came thanks to a confluence of factors. Increased computing power, large-scale data collection, and advancements in machine learning---all accompanied by dramatic decreases in costs---have resulted in machines that now have the ability to exhibit complex &quot;intelligent&quot; behaviors. They can navigate in real-world environments, process natural language, diagnose illnesses, predict future events, and even conquer strategy games. These abilities, in turn, have allowed companies and governments to entrust machines with responsibilities once exclusively reserved for humans---including influencing hiring decisions, bail release conditions, loan considerations, medical treatment and police deployment. But with these great new powers, of course, come great new responsibilities. The first public deployments of AI have seen ample evidence of the technology's disruptive---and destructive---capabilities. AI-powered systems have killed and maimed, filled social networks with hate, and been accused of shaping the course of elections. And as the technology proliferates, its governance will increasingly fall upon lawyers involved in the design and development of new products, oversight bodies and government agencies. AI is the biggest addition to technology law and policy since the rise of the internet, and its influence spreads far beyond the tech sector. As such, those entering practice in a wide variety of fields need to understand AI from the ground up in order to competently assess and influence its policy, legal and product implications as deployments scale across industries in the coming years. This course is designed to teach precisely that. It seeks to equip students with an understanding of the basics of AI and machine learning systems by studying the implications of the technology along the design\/deployment continuum, moving from (1) system inputs (data collection) to (2) system design (engineering) and finally to (3) system outputs (product features). This input\/design\/output framework will be used throughout the course to survey substantive engineering, policy and legal issues arising at each of those key stages. In doing so, the course will span topics including privacy, bias, discrimination, intellectual property, torts, transparency and accountability. The course will also feature leading experts from a variety of AI disciplines and professional backgrounds. An important aspect of the course is gaining an understanding of the technical underpinnings of AI, which will be packaged in an easy-to-understand, introductory manner with no prior technical background required. The writing assignments will center on reflection papers on legal, regulatory and policy analysis of current issues involving AI. The course will be offered for two units of credit (H\/P\/R\/F). Grading will be determined by attendance, class participation and written assignments. Given the course's multi-disciplinary focus, students outside of the law school, particularly those studying computer science, engineering or business, are welcome.

How will society respond as versatile robots and machine-learning systems displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems respect our ethical principles when they make decisions at speeds and for rationales that exceed our ability to comprehend? What, if any, legal rights and responsibilities should we grant them? And should we regard them merely as sophisticated tools or as a newly emerging form of life?

Drawing on the lecturer's experience as General Counsel of Facebook, the course will focus on actual controversies that confront practicing lawyers as they grapple with these evolving issues in a fast-moving environment of innovation and disruption. In less than 15 years of existence (and less than seven years as a public company), Facebook has confronted an unending set of legal challenges, across the full range of subject matter, and in the process has helped define technology law in the 21st century. From questions of privacy law, to antitrust, to intellectual property law, to cutting-edge litigation, and most recently to election law and the political process, Facebook has been at the forefront of many of the defining legal developments of our era. In order to navigate these issues effectively, lawyers must combine legal expertise with practical business judgment as well as an understanding of the broader social and political context -- and in this course, students will develop those skills by studying Facebook legal controversies from the past and the present.

The launch of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, China's ambitious global economic plan, has taken legal reforms in the country to another level, as numerous measures are being undertaken to ensure the success of this initiative, which is associated with tremendous legal challenges.  This introductory course is designed to provide an overview of the Chinese legal system and to discuss legal and business issues related to the above-mentioned economic evolution spearheaded by China but having an impact around the world. The course will specifically examine Chinese legal rules and principles in select business-related areas, including intellectual property, dispute resolution, foreign investment vehicles, mergers and acquisitions, antimonopoly law, and artificial intelligence. Through active class participation and analysis of legal and business cases, students will learn both the law on the books and the law in action, as well as strategies that Chinese and international businesses alike can use to overcome limitations in the Chinese legal system.  Leaders from the law and business communities will be invited to share their experiences and insights. This course is particularly suitable for law students, MBA students, and students enrolled in the East Asian Studies Program. Undergraduates who have permission from the instructor may also take this course. A Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration Form is available on the SLS Registrar's Office website.  Elements used in grading: class participation (20%), team project (40%), and extended take-home exam (40%).  For the team project component, students will work with another student enrolled in the class to produce an analysis of a judicial case in China and discuss, for example, the implications of the related Chinese legal principles for businesses and\/or major differences between these principles and similar U.S. legal principles.  Quality team projects may have the opportunity to be included in the professional journal published by the China Guiding Cases Project (&quot;CGCP&quot;), which is led by Dr. Mei Gechlik, the instructor, and her global team of nearly 200 members.  Team projects selected for publication will receive editorial input from the CGCP and authors may have a chance to present their papers at CGCP events.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Extended Take-Home Exam","name":"AEXA","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXTENDED"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Comparative Law & International Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"COMP&INTL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31445,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Extended Take-Home Exam.

Over 50% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers. Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States, including European human rights and fundamental rights protection standards. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues for breach of EU law as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts. Secondly, we will explore the legal framework governing business activities in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital, and persons (enterprises, workforce, immigration), including the legal and economic implications of Brexit, (b) EU competition (antitrust) law, and (c) the new digital European Internal Market and EU data protection and privacy laws. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU.

What legal problems arise when firms go global?  Through a series of case studies, we put you in the driver's seat and ask you to consider the challenges of doing business around the world, subject to multiple and sometimes inconsistent national laws.  We will examine how treaties, international agreements, and informal norms can constrain or supplement national laws and review the risks of doing business in nations whose laws are ineffective or unreliable.  We also consider some of the costs of globalization.  We'll hear from current or former general counsel from global firms such as Intel and G.E.

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Berkeley). Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. In addition to the regular Monday class, classes will meet for the live negotiations on one Thursday evening on-campus at 7:00 PM (10\/18) and four Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM (10\/6, 10\/13, 10\/27 and 11\/10) in the San Francisco office of DLA Piper (555 Mission Street; close to Montgomery St. BART station). Due to the Thursday and Saturday classes, this class will conclude on November 12. The course will be limited by lottery to twelve (12) law students (additional students from business or engineering may also participate). Attention Waitlist Students: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of their position on the waitlist and degree of study; all waitlist students are encouraged to attend the first class and will be notified as spaces become available. Attention Non-Law Students: You must complete and submit a Non-Law Student Course Add Request Form to the Law School Registrar's Office (Room 100). See Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration on the SLS Registrar's Office website. Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 7821) or comparable prior experience is recommended. A primer on basic negotiations skills will be offered at a time TBD as an alternative for students who have not had a prior negotiations class or experience. Elements used in grading: Class participation, written assignments and final paper.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

The practice is peripatetic, with many international arbitration lawyers basing themselves in law firms in New York, Washington D.C., Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major world commercial centers.  The course will deal with the internationalist elements of the subject matter, but also examine international commercial arbitration from an American perspective. Students can expect to review both foreign and US commentaries, statutes and case law. The course will comprise of five main topics: (1) an introduction to the field of international commercial arbitration; (2) the agreement to arbitrate; (3) the arbitrators; (4) the arbitration process; and (5) the arbitral award.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various tactical, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach examines the need for the parties to conflicts to address the following questions in order to have prospects of creating peaceful relationships: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? We will consider both particular conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the South African transition to majority rule, as well as cross-cutting issues, such as the role international legal rules play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, the ways intragroup dynamics affect intergroup conflict resolution efforts, and the role of criminal accountability for atrocities following civil wars.

We will examine major sources of international human rights law---including treaties, customary international law, and national law---as well as the institutions in which human rights are contested, adjudicated, and enforced.  Key situses of human rights activity include multilateral organizations, like the United Nations Security Council and Human Rights Council; international, regional, and national courts and tribunals; and quasi-judicial treaty bodies, like the U.N. Committee Against Torture. This degree of jurisdictional redundancy offers an opportunity to explore questions of institutional design and interaction as well as processes of normative diffusion. The course will also consider the role of non-state actors---including non-governmental organizations, corporations, terrorist organizations, and ordinary individuals---in promoting and violating human rights.  In addition to this survey of the human rights ecosystem, the course will engage some of the fundamental theoretical debates underlying the international human rights project with a focus on perennial questions of legitimacy, justiciability, compliance, and efficacy. Finally, we will explore a range of threats and challenges to the promotion of human rights---both perennial and novel---including economic under-development, terrorism, national security over-reach, patriarchy, and racism.

The rise of international investment arbitration has generated a new and exciting practice area in global law firms. This course will cover four broad areas: (I) the historical and policy origins of international investment law; (II) the substantive obligations and standards governing the investor-state relationship; (III) the investor-state arbitration process; and (IV) current controversies over the legitimacy and desirability of ISDS. The course uses materials from international investment treaty texts, case law, and commentaries to enable students to evaluate and apply legal doctrine to future situations.

Over the past decade, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon.  As these ad hoc institutions wind down, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has become fully functional, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency.  Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria---among others---go unanswered.  This intensive mini-course in the early September Term will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international criminal justice and to the political environment in which it operates. The classroom component (offered at Stanford during the first week of the course) will undertake an elemental analysis of international crimes as they have evolved in international law and focus on the challenges of interpreting these norms in a criminal prosecution.  Jurisprudence from the various international tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof.  The course will culminate in a visit to The Hague in the second week of the course, during which time students will meet with principals from the tribunals, including prosecutors, judges, administrators, and members of the defense bar.  In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, and public international law.  The course grade will be based on a series of short papers and active in-class engagement with the assigned materials.

We will then examine the operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law.

This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at University of Vienna Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Vienna will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long-term supply contract, or some combination. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted in-person. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the professional and cultural dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party. Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. The course will be limited by consent to eight (8) students. Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 7821) or comparable prior experience is recommended. Elements used in grading: Class participation, written assignments and final paper. There will be two preparatory sessions at Stanford during February and March 2018. Students in the class will travel to Vienna on or before Saturday, March 24th. Class sessions will begin on Sunday afternoon, March 25, and continue all day Monday, March 26 through Wednesday, March 28th.

Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than other parts? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? And most importantly, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is designed especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political\/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP\/R\/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H\/P\/R\/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from Section 01 into Section 02 with consent of the instructor. Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper.

Topics will include the human rights crisis facing Mexico, in particular, forced disappearances, summary executions and torture.  We will consider, for example, the forced disappearance of 43 students in September 2014 (Ayotzinapa) in at least one session.  The current political and human rights crisis facing Venezuela will be considered, likely by an expert guest speaker.  So too will the peace process in Colombia and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.  Other sessions will consider social conflict and justice issues across the region.  These issues will include the resurgence of populism in the United States and Latin America and its effects on social justice and human rights, the continued relevance of the Organization of American States and its human rights bodies, migration and human rights, the rights of indigenous and traditional peoples and models of development, among others.

The Course will consider issues of implementation, and the types of measures and forms of relief that can be sought from the Court and the Commission. The inter-American system has played a crucial role in opening spaces for debate on human rights protections in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing protections at the domestic level, and supporting civil society in its quest for accountability for massive human rights violations.  The system has also played a role in civil society efforts to bring the human rights debate home, including in the United States.

Yet it is also a means by which political communities protect themselves, pursue collective interests, and defend their rights.  When, if ever, is the recourse to armed force justified, either as a legal or moral matter?  And what rules, if any, do law and morality impose on the conduct of war?  The course explores both the international law regime and the just war theory principles governing war.  We will begin by considering when states may permissibly use force, and how changing security threats, including terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the impulse to respond to widespread humanitarian atrocities challenge and are reshaping the legal framework on recourse to force.  We will then explore the rules governing the conduct of warfare itself, including the constraints on the means and methods of war, the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants in armed conflict, and the rules governing the treatment of detainees.  A particular focus of the class will be the application of these rules in non-traditional, asymmetric conflicts between states and non-state armed groups.  Throughout, we will consider the relationship between just war theory and the international law regime governing the use of force, when they conform with one another and when they diverge, and why.

The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development --- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process? The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary. Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP\/R\/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H\/P\/R\/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive EL credit or R credit. Automatic grading penalty waived for submission of the final work products. CONSENT APPLICATION: The seminar is open by consent to up to sixteen (16) JD, SPILS, and LLM students, and graduate students from other departments within Stanford University. This course is taught in conjunction with the India Field Study component (Law 5026). Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 5026 with consent of the instructor (12 students will come to India). To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

The workshop will meet every other week in the winter and spring quarters, and (we expect) most quarters over the next two years.  Students may sign up for as many quarters they wish, and will receive one credit for each quarter they are enrolled. Each session will be devoted to presentations of one or two student works-in-progress. Every student is expected to present his or her own work at least once over the quarters she or he is enrolled in the Workshop, and to provide constructive oral feedback on others' work. We welcome students who are just starting to explore their interest in an academic career;  if you have any questions about whether the course is suitable for you, please contact Prof. Barbara Fried (bfried@stanford.edu) or Prof. Bernadette Meyler (bmeyler@law.stanford.edu).  Attendance is mandatory (except of course for extenuating circumstances). There are no written requirements for the course, and no requirement that the work presented be original to the Workshop. Students may wish to use the Workshop as an opportunity to expand on seminar papers or pursue independent research projects for which they are getting separate credit through one of the research tracks (e.g., directed research, dissertation). Whether students are working on a new project or revising an old, the expectation is that students will develop their topics independently of the course. Students who would like to participate in the Workshop but feel they need help in developing a workable research topic should consult faculty members ahead of time. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance.

In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, legal issues involving farm animals and animals in entertainment, and federal statutes regarding certain groups of animals. The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to legal concepts associated with animals in new ways. Students have called it a great bar review class, because concepts from many areas of law are covered with respect to their application to animals and their interests. More and more firms, large and small, are providing pro bono (and paying) work in the animal law area, as the field gains momentum and reputability in the legal community. Mr. Wagman is a lawyer in San Francisco, with a full-time animal law practice, representing organizations and individuals in a wide range of cases. He is one of the authors of the Animal Law casebook, two other animal legal texts, and has been practicing animal law for most of his 26-year career. His practice includes litigation, consultation, legislative work, and extensive writing and lecturing on various animal law topics. The class includes regular updates on his current cases, as well as real-life experiences from the front lines of the animal law frontier. Special Instructions: Students have the option to write an independent research paper in lieu of the final exam with consent of instructor. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading: Final exam or 18 page independent research paper.

Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer meaning. Grading is based on class participation, two in-class moot court presentations, and, based on individual student preference, either a final exam (a one-day take-home essay with a word limit) or a final research paper.

Foundations of the law firm model such as bespoke client services, &quot;billable&quot; hours, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries), high associate-to-partner ratios and summer associate programs are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era. Sophisticated clients today are utilizing a wide range of internal and external service providers and technologies such as artificial intelligence for their legal work. The diversity of how legal services are delivered and priced to clients is rapidly increasing.

The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined. In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.

By interpreting and implementing statutes, adjudicating disputes, and promulgating regulations and policies, agencies affect an enormous range of issues --- from climate change to communications policy, from innovation to immigration, from financial institutions to federalism, and from public health to public education. Specific topics encompassed by administrative law include the relationship between agencies and the Legislature; the constitutional rules and political pressures that shape agencies; the major statutes affecting how agencies work, particularly the Administrative Procedure Act; how senior officials in the executive branch seek to control agency actions; how agencies choose among policymaking methods and make judgments about the costs and benefits of regulatory policies as they implement statutes; and how courts review agency action. The course will address these topics through cases and examples drawn from separation of powers doctrine, the constitutional law of due process, and the implementation of statutes. A major theme cutting across these topics is how the law seeks --- yet often fails --- to resolve tensions between goals associated with political accountability, scientific and technical rationality, and adjudicatory fairness.

These policy decisions range from the seemingly trivial, such as the size of holes in Swiss cheese, to matters of life-and-death importance, such as how to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These agencies also range in age, organization, and duties. There is the postal service, which was created over 200 years ago, and changed almost 50 years ago from a cabinet-level department to a government corporation. On the newer side, there is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established in 2011 to protect consumers in the financial arena and faces considerable scrutiny on constitutional and other grounds. In this quarter of Administrative Law, we will consider the creation and control of the modern administrative state. Topics will include the structure of administrative agencies and their place in a governing scheme of separated but overlapping powers, delegation of authority to agencies, types and requirements of agency decisionmaking, availability and scope of judicial review of agency action (and inaction), and other forms of agency oversight. We will apply concepts through many recent examples.

Using a broad mix of case law, case studies, and scholarly analysis, this seminar will interrogate those attacks-including their historical roots, their theoretical justifications, and their practical effects. We will first study &quot;replacement reforms&quot;-attempts to jettison the common law in favor of alternative compensation mechanisms, including workers' compensation, auto no-fault, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, housed within the U.S. Court of Claims. Second, we will study modern tort reform initiatives, often dubbed &quot;discouragement reforms,&quot; which have chiseled away at damages and chilled personal injury victims' incentives and capacity to seek relief. Finally, we will study the United States Supreme Court's own tort reform activity, including recent jurisprudence limiting punitive damages, preferencing arbitration, and granting broad preemptive effect to agency actions. Through this analysis, students will develop a deeper and richer understanding of the tort system, its contemporary operation and excesses, and the uneasy but undeniably important place tort law-and civil litigation more generally-occupies in contemporary American society.

We will begin by focusing first on background legal principles and then on applying those legal principles to each debated policy. We will also consider the real world consequences that flow from different legal outcomes. There is no casebook. Instead, weekly readings will consist of judicial decisions, statutory and regulatory texts, and published articles (both academic and popular).

In considering this issue, we will address debates about constitutional interpretation (including both originalism and living constitutionalism), the nature and features of constitutional change within the American context, the role of federalism and the separation of powers in the constitutional scheme, and the nature of American constitutionalism as opposed to English and continental European models. We will tackle these debates in the context of some specific contemporary controversies about the Constitution, including: How do the civil rights movement and other social movements impact our understanding of the Constitution?; Does the Constitution reject a European-style inquisitorial process in favor of an Anglo-American vision of due process?; How important is consensus within the Supreme Court to establishing the legitimacy of constitutional meanings?, and; What is the Constitution, and how much does it include outside of the written document? Throughout we will be contemplating the extent to which our interpretation of the constitution depends on our vision of American democracy and the good society. Requirements for the course include regular class participation and either four response papers or a substantial research paper; students who take the research paper option will receive four units and &quot;R&quot; credit.

We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationship between ethics and culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion. A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (e.g. Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devises (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Epi pen pricing, Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (e.g. NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid (Oxfam case)). Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice. Attendance required. Class participation important (with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class). Strong emphasis on rigorous analysis, critical thinking and testing ideas in real-world contexts. Please note that this course will require one evening session on a Wednesday or Thursday in lieu of the final class session the first week of June, so the course will end before Memorial Day. Students wishing to take the course who are unable to sign up within the enrollment limit should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud at susanl1@stanford.edu. The course offers credit toward Ethics in Society, Public Policy core requirements (if taken in combination with PUBLPOL 103E or PUBLPOL 103F), and Science, Technology and Society majors and satisfies the undergraduate Ways of Thinking Ethical Reasoning requirement.

We will maintain an interdisciplinary focus throughout as we consider how social, cultural, and political forces shape, and are shaped by, legal doctrine. All students taking the seminar for 2 units will either write a final research paper of approximately 18 pages (for R credit) or a take a final exam. Students who wish to write a longer R paper (approx. 26 pages) may enroll in the seminar for 3 units. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.

This seminar will examine this &quot;intent standard&quot; and its significant barriers to racial justice litigation.  The course will review social science research, including studies on implicit bias, racial anxiety, stereotyping, and other concepts, to explore how contemporary discrimination manifests.  We will address how legal advocates and the law can utilize such research to challenge and remedy discrimination through strategic litigation.  We will examine real-world examples of this, including in the context of school discipline and the school-to-prison pipeline.

Professor Lawrence Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, and several of the Law School's esteemed group of Supreme Court litigators are expected to participate in one or more of the sessions.  The 18 students in the seminar will be divided into two courts. During each sitting, one of the courts will hear arguments in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court, while two of the students from the court not sitting that week will present oral arguments. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix between criminal and civil cases.  Each student will be assigned the role of a particular Justice for the entire quarter.  Each student's task while sitting on cases is to do his or her best to understand that particular justice, based on that justice's prior opinions and judicial philosophy.  In this sense, the seminar is also intended to help promote insight into the role of judicial personality and philosophy within the decisional process.  The weekly seminars will proceed as follows: In preparation for each week's session, all students (whether they are the two students arguing that week, the nine students judging that week, or the seven students observing that week) will read the lower courts' decisions, the briefs (the party briefs and selected amicus briefs) and the major precedents implicated.  During the first portion of each week's session (approximately one hour), two of the students (who are members of the Court that is not sitting that week) will present oral arguments to the nine &quot;justices&quot; sitting that week. The arguments will be based on the briefs that were actually filed in the case.  During the second segment of each week's session (approximately 45 minutes), the &quot;justices&quot; who are sitting that week will &quot;conference&quot; the case while the other non-sitting students, students who argued, instructors and guests will observe.  Again, each student will be in the role of a particular justice.  At the end of the &quot;conference,&quot; the opinion-writing will be assigned to one &quot;justice&quot; in the majority and one &quot;justice&quot; in the dissent.  During the final portion of each session (approximately one hour), the instructors, guests and students will engage in a broad discussion of what they just observed.  This may include analysis of the briefing, discussion about the oral argument, reflections on the &quot;conference,&quot; and, more generally, a discussion about the case and its significance.  After each class, the student assigned to draft the majority opinion will have two weeks to circulate a draft to the &quot;Court.&quot;  The student writing the dissent will then have two weeks to circulate his or her opinion. The other sitting &quot;justices&quot; can join one of these opinions, request some changes as a condition of joining, or decide to write separately.  Over the course of the Quarter, then, each student will argue one case, sit on four or five cases, and draft at least one opinion.  Special instructions: 1. Because this is a simulation with assigned roles, students who are accepted into the seminar may not drop without permission of the instructor.  2. Because of the nature of the writing projects (with extensive interaction with other students), the normal deadline for Winter Quarter papers is waived and final papers must be submitted by the Spring Quarter deadline.  Elements used in grading:  Students will be graded based on the quality of their participation as justices, their oral argument, and their written opinions.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":7,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Public Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"PUBLLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":31128,"component":"SIM","curr_class_size":17,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

One writer suggested that the welfare state had not died, it had merely &quot;moved to Asia&quot; along with industrialization. This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigration. We will then turn to the trend toward austerity and retrenchment, and the effect of globalization for the future of the welfare state.  Course Requirements.  Participation\/Discussion (25%). Students are responsible to complete all readings and to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussion. Each student is responsible to lead a portion of the discussion twice per quarter.  Short Reaction Papers (25%). All students must complete 5 reaction papers related to the weekly readings of 2 to 3 pages in length. Reaction papers will include a list of questions to be addressed in that week's discussion. All reaction papers must be posted to coursework in advance of class so that the student(s) leading that week's discussion can incorporate the questions into that week's discussion.  Final Options (50%). Students have the option of completing one final paper of 20 pages in length OR 4 essays of 5 -6 pages each addressing the readings in weeks that the student did NOT complete reaction papers. Topics for 20 page papers must be approved by me in advance, and may be related to a student's dissertation or master's research or may be a stand-alone topic. Papers may take the form of a research proposal and need not contain original empirical research. Shorter papers should engage thoroughly with the literature on the selected topic, and should bring additional sources other than those read for class to bear on the topic of choice.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Seminar with Concurrent Policy Lab: Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures.  Policy Lab Client: National Women's Law Center:  Over the past six years, the issue of campus sexual assault has exploded into the public discourse. While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators, launching one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. Statistics are equally disturbing in the middle and high school context. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 250 colleges and universities currently under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints. At the same time, students accused of sexual assault have complained of botched processes driven by a &quot;campus rape over-correction&quot; that denied them a fair disciplinary hearing. It is clear that schools are struggling to develop and implement policies and procedures that satisfy their legal obligations in this area. While the future of federal enforcement under the Trump Administration is uncertain, schools are still subject to federal and state law that require them have policies and procedures to address sexual harassment and violence.  This course focuses on the legal and policy issues surrounding the highly challenging area of investigation and adjudication of sexual assault and other gender-motivated violence on college campuses and in K12 schools. It will cover the federal and state legal frameworks governing these procedures including Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Clery Act, and examine current cases as well as the rapidly-evolving legal, federal regulatory, and political environment surrounding this issue. Guest speakers working in the area will help to broaden the class's understanding of the subject matter. Students in this seminar will have the opportunity to participate in the invitation-only national conference entitled The Way Forward: Title IX Advocacy in the Trump Era, which will be held May 1-2 at Stanford Law School and is organized in conjunction with the National Women's Law Center. See [http:\/\/conferences.law.stanford.edu\/thewayforward-title9\/] for more information on the conference.  Concurrent Seminar and Policy Lab:  The seminar is taught concurrently with the Policy Lab (also entitled &quot;Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures&quot;). All students registered for the seminar participate in the Policy Lab, which works with the National Women's Law Center toward the development of a set of evidence-based and legally compliant model policies and procedures. Given all the controversy, surprisingly little is actually known about the policies and processes that are currently in use, nor is there any way of easily ascertaining what the majority of an institution's &quot;peer schools&quot; are doing with respect to solving a challenge or addressing an issue. There is no set of &quot;best practices&quot; to which school administrators can easily turn. Students will analyze cutting-edge issues related to school-based gender-motivated violence and work on a white paper for the NWLC that includes both legal and empirical research into the policies and procedures currently in use around the country. Throughout the class, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what they are learning and how it applies in a professional context. The eventual goal of this Policy Lab is the development in conjunction with NWLC of a free, web-based, open-source set of adaptable model policies and procedures that are targeted for different market segments (i.e., large private, large public, small private, HBCU, community colleges, and k12).  Course Schedule and Optional Travel:  The first three weeks of the class there will be two meetings per week, on Tuesday and Thursday from 4:15 to 6:15. Students will meet with Fatima Goss Graves, Senior Vice President for Program at the NWLC during week 2 to hear her expectations regarding the project and ask questions. During weeks 4-6 the class will meet once per week, on Thursday from 4:15-7:15 and small groups will work on their assigned sections of the project. On Thursday, May 4 (week 5), the class will meet with special guest Catherine Lhamon, former Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights and have the opportunity to discuss the project with her and receive her feedback. During Week 7, the class will take an optional trip to Washington DC to present the completed project to the staff of the NWLC on Friday May 19. The class will be housed at Stanford in Washington from Thursday May 18, and will attend a hearing of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the morning of May 19 and then present their project in the afternoon. Travel expenses (other than incidentals) are provided. On Saturday, May 20 we will have the option to meet with other policy makers and activists as well as sightsee (including an attempted visit to the National Museum of African American History). We will return to Stanford on Sunday May 21. There will be no class during week 8.  Enrollment, Assignments, and Evaluation; The Seminar and concurrent policy lab are both open to law students, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates. The seminar has two sections. Section 1 is a 2-hour seminar and students enrolling in Section 1 must also enroll in the Law 805R Policy Lab (1-hour). Section 2 is a 3-hour seminar, and students may enroll in that Section without concurrent enrollment in the Policy Lab. Regardless of the section of enrollment, all students will do the same assignments and be evaluated on the same criteria. All students will complete written work equivalent to a 26 page research paper. Law students will receive &quot;R&quot; credit for the seminar.  Elements used in grading:  Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and\/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured &quot;public law&quot; litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures.

The New Deal resulted in a major expansion -- against the resistance of conservative courts -- in the size and responsibilities of the Federal government to regulate the economy and secure citizens against risks of unemployment, sickness and old age. Part II covers the expansion of the New Deal after World War II to new forms of welfare and regulation (such as Medicare and environmental law) and what we now call the Rights Revolution --movements of subordinated or marginalized groups to claim equal rights (African-Americans, women, the disabled, gays and lesbians) or fair treatment by government (criminal suspects, welfare recipients, mental patients, prisoners).

The seminar provides a general introduction to some of the laws governing children's sexual autonomy as well as necessary protections from sexual abuse; however, the seminar's primary purpose is to teach students about how the law discursively constructs children as it attempts to protect them.  Specifically, students will explore how laws designed to protect children from sexual exploitation also naturalize certain assumptions about children's perceptions, cognitive capacities, interests and vulnerabilities.  Our discussions will explore how the law, while attempting to catalogue and regulate the potential threats children face, also instantiates certain ideas about children's potential sex-related injuries and how these injures can affect them over time.  Finally, seminar discussions will explore whether there are any inconsistencies between the understanding of childhood, sexual injury, capacity, and autonomy in various areas of state child protection laws, federal constitutional law, and relevant federal statutes.  In addition to considering how laws regulating children's sexuality affect children, the seminar will also examine how the same laws effectively constrain adults' behavior, as well as shape our understanding of the role of certain social institutions. Laws intended to more generally protect children from sexual exploitation also regulate children's relationships to their parents, affect our understanding of the role of schools, and even our understanding of the role libraries and the internet play in educating citizens.  Seminar discussions will focus on how discursive constructs and social understandings about children contained in law both constrain and enable us in discussions of child sexuality.  We will also consider how these constructs and understandings empower certain institutions by legitimating certain kinds of intervention.

While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a potentially higher proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. People of color, LGBT students, disabled individuals and other vulnerable groups are at increased risk. This is also a significant problem in k12 education. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by what they describe as an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators. These survivors have launched one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 300 colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints as of July 2017.  At the same time, this heightened response has led to a series of high-profile lawsuits by accused students who assert that they were falsely accused or subjected to mishandled investigations that lacked sufficient due process protections. The one thing that survivors and accused students appear to agree on is that colleges are not handling these matters appropriately. Colleges have meanwhile complained of being whipsawed between survivors, accused students, interest groups, and enforcement authorities.  The election of President Trump has now created significant uncertainty about how this issue will be handled by the Department of Education going forward. The Trump Administration took the extraordinary step this September of rolling back all of the Obama Administration guidance on this subject. Meanwhile Congress has been unable to pass legislation addressing the issue, though there are several bipartisan bills under consideration.  This course focuses on the legal, policy, and political issues surrounding sexual assault on college campuses. We will learn background about sexual violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for survivors in the educational context. We will also study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. We will hear from guest speakers who are actively involved in shaping policy and advocating in this area, including lawyers, lobbyists, filmmakers, journalists, and policymakers.  The subject matter of this course is sensitive and students are expected to treat the material with sensitivity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and\/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources and Title IX staff are available for those who need them.  This course was previously a Sophomore College Class that is now being offered as a regular quarter-length course.

These issues include: 1) immigration law reform and DACA, 2) the role of the Department of Justice in reforming local and federal criminal law enforcement, 3) the role of government policy in regulating the economy and financial system, in facilitating heath insurance, and in remedying economic inequality, 4) the proper balance between national security and civil liberties\/human rights, as exemplified by the debates over the status of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and drone warfare.  In each of these areas, and others, debates about law and policy had reached a seeming, or potential, consensus in early 2009, but that consensus quickly fell apart.  In each area, the gap between differing formulations of law and policy that had existed until recently has widened.  Keeping in mind the time limitations of this course, we will briefly examine most of these of law and policy -- the governing legal doctrines and policies, their evolution since 2009, and their present and future prospects.  The course will ask: What accounts for these differing visions of law and policy? What accounts for the inability of the political and legal system to resolve them?  What are the possible ways forward?  Class format will consist mainly of readings and class discussion, and students are encouraged to bring their own perspectives to bear on these difficult and timely issues.

Judges sentence defendants based on &quot;risk scores;&quot; regulators take enforcement actions based on predicted violations; advertisers target materials based on demographic attributes; and employers evaluate applicants and employees based on machine-learned models.

Algorithms might discriminate, for instance, based on race or gender.

Marriage has long been the primary locus of such relationships, the foundation of family life.  In recent decades, though, marriage has undergone unprecedented changes. Sustained political advocacy and judicial decisions have opened marriage to same sex couples. Yet marriage equality has triumphed at a time when marriage is less universal and less robust as a social institution than ever. More American adults than ever are unmarried; more than a third of those who do marry will divorce. Unprecedented numbers of children are now born to unmarried parents. And marriage rates and stability have diverged across racial and socioeconomic groups as never before.  What is one to make of these changes? And how should law and policy respond?  The course will examine the constitutional and statutory doctrine governing marriage and other intimate relationships.

During the past half century their applicant pools have grown considerably--now including women, minorities, immigrants, and international students--while the sizes of their student bodies remain virtually unchanged. The broader social and economic context has shifted as well.  With globalization, the advance of technology and the resulting labor market shifts, advanced education is seen as more important than ever to getting ahead. Yet, even as elite universities seem central to Americans' hopes and dream, they have also come under attack, viewed as disconnected from, and alien to, &quot;regular Americans.&quot;  This course will engage these developments through considering a pivotal question:  How do and should elite educational institutions choose among the many applicants vying for admission? Two principles loom large in the ethos of selective college admissions: diversity and merit.  Throughout the course, we will take a critical stance toward these claims. For example, how much does and should merit shape admissions decisions?  What are the rationales for using prior grades and test scores to assess applicants?  Similarly, what are the costs and benefit of the diversity rationale? Should schools take account of race, socioeconomic class, or neither?

This first portion of the course will consider institutional-legitimacy issues facing the Senate, including the appointment of senators to fill vacancies as well as disputes concerning Senate rules and procedures such as the filibuster and holds. The second part of the course will explore how the Senate interfaces with the Constitution and the Supreme Court. It will examine how senators should regard the issue of constitutionality in voting on legislation, be it campaign-finance reform, internet decency, or health care. This part of the course will also consider how senators should approach proposed constitutional amendments. The final portion of the course will review the wide range of issues that have emerged in recent years regarding the constitutional relationship between the Senate and the Executive Branch, including the increasingly acrimonious issue of the standard to apply to executive appointments under the advice and consent power. Particular emphasis on this part of the course will be given to issues that have gained greater prominence since 9\/11, including the relationship between enacted, constitutional legislation and the presidential assertion of Article II powers, as well as the Senate's abdication of its Article I war-declaration power.

The course will examine immigration initiatives of the current administration and the federal administrative decision-making process. The goal is to identify strategies and mechanisms for administrative reform in the future that would further the protections of non-citizens during a period of global hostility to migrants. One significant part of the course will be for each seminar student to participate in mapping the administrative and sub-regulatory changes to immigration policy adopted by the Trump administration and to analyze avenues for reform.  The seminar will examine the federal administrative process and the role litigation for furthering reform from a theoretical, doctrinal, and practical perspective based on selected readings, guest speakers, and the instructor's hands-on experience serving in the Obama administration as a senior immigration policy official in the Department of Homeland Security and prior role as the founder and director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project.  Requirements:  A prior course in immigration law or supervised work in a clinical, professional, academic, or other setting.

These calls arise across the political spectrum. On the left, there are calls for constitutional amendments, for example, to address campaign finance, the right to bear arms, and the electoral college. On the right, there are specific proposals to undo the flag burning decision and to ban abortion but also calls to consider more structural changes such as giving states the ability to invalidate federal laws. Given the level of political division in the country, combined with the inability to achieve governmental consensus on an increasing number of issues, more and more advocacy as well as accompanying resources are likely to be devoted to such causes. This is in part because the amendment avenue allows options independent of Presidential and even Congressional action. This seminar will examine thoroughly the law of the amendment process, its history, and its current role in our political system and public debate. It will also consider the way in which the Constitution can be and has been &quot;amended&quot; through alternate means vis a vis Article V. In so doing, this seminar should enable students critically to evaluate and use proper source material with regard to issues that have arisen or are likely to arise concerning proposed constitutional amendments or constitutional conventions.  The first part of the course will explore the origins of Article V including background on the comparative amendability of other written constitutions. A major focus of this section is the centrality of Article V to the structure of the Constitution. After reviewing the materials relating to the drafting of Article V, this section will review the adoption of the Bill of Rights as well as the apparent unique unamendability of the equal representation of the states in the Senate. The second part will review the history of efforts, both successful and unsuccessful, to amend the Constitution, from early corrective amendments to the post-Civil War Reconstructive amendments and then to the Progressive Era amendments including, in particular, the switch to the direct election of Senators. The modern voting-related amendments will also be reviewed. This section will also consider views that have been advanced as to when and how it is proper or &quot;appropriate&quot; to amend the Constitution, the standard that members of Congress should employ in voting on proposed amendments, and the history of calls for constitutional conventions to amend the Constitution. In addition, this section will analyze the use of various routes to &quot;amending&quot; the Constitution apart from Article V. The third and final part of the course will then examine current proposals and advocacy for constitutional amendments across the political spectrum. Special emphasis will be placed on the calls for a constitutional convention and its likely scope.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

The law used to be much simpler than it is today.  The law treated marriage as the near exclusive setting for the rearing of children, defining the woman who gave birth to the child was the mother, and the man to whom she was married as the father.  In recent decades, that simple legal principle has collapsed under the weight of social and technological change. The central social change is the reconfiguration of marriage and the multiplicity of settings in which children are raised. The advent of same sex marriage and same sex couples undermine longstanding assumptions about the legal definition of parent. And the fact that 4 in every 10 children are born to unmarried couples, and that nearly half of all married couples will divorce (often with either or both partners remarrying) introduce a dizzying array of possible family configurations.  Advances in genetic testing complicate matters further, by allowing biological parents to be identified with near certainty. Thus, there is less reason to treat a woman's husband as her child's father. Many couples use reproductive technologies involving the donation of sperm, the donation of eggs or even the use of a surrogate mother to gestate the child. The use of such technologies can result in many adults having some form of tie to the child, a situation that has prompted some jurisdictions to recognize the possibilities of more than 2 parents!  In sum, nonmarital, nonbiological, and same-sex parenting have become central, rather than peripheral features of the familial landscape. These changes highlight provocative and fundamental inquiries: What, exactly, does, and should, make one a parent in the view of the law? And how should the state allocate rights and responsbilities, related to custody, financial support and visitation, as families fracture and reconfigure?

This course will examine the legacies of atrocities and the institutions and processes that governments and citizens most often use to address them, comparing approaches from across the globe. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the prosecution of Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet; Argentina's reparations to victims of its military regime; and the International Criminal Court are among the best-known policy responses to those problems. In addition, non-legal interventions---such as the Berlin Holocaust Memorial and Nelson Mandela's many symbolic gestures toward reconciliation with white South Africans---may have important social and political effects. In addition to initiatives at the national and international levels, we will devote some attention to transitional justice at the local level. A recurring theme throughout the course will be the connections between atrocities and transitional justice measures intended to address them, on the one hand, and economic justice and development, on the other.

But the operative term, &quot;discrimination,&quot; is typically quite vaguely defined in statutory language.  As a consequence, courts and legal analysts have developed a number of theories of discrimination.  These theories can be inconsistent with each other and with popular definitions of discrimination; for instance, some laws forbidding &quot;discrimination&quot; forbid differential treatment, some permit it under limited circumstances and some require it.  Discrimination may or not require a specific mental state (&quot;discriminatory intent&quot;) or specific consequences (&quot;discriminatory effect&quot; or &quot;disparate impact&quot;).  Arguably, &quot;discrimination&quot; is, in practice, as much a question of values and norms as it is a matter of fact.  This class will explore the concept of discrimination in case law, philosophy and legal theory.

Historically, family law had two main functions. It created a framework for bearing and raising children, and organized the children's parents' coupledom. Gender, sexuality and reproduction were closely interwoven and subject to certain expectations. Sex was only allowed in the context of marriage, which formed the gateway to reproduction. Children born outside of wedlock had inferior rights. Women were placed under their husband's control to ensure their sexual fidelity.  From the 1960's on, societal changes shook the traditional conception of the family to its foundations. Women gained economic independence and started challenging their traditional role in the family. Birth control cut the ties between sexuality and reproduction. The position of marriage as the sole seat of both coupledom and childbearing started to erode. The disconnection of gender, sexuality and reproduction opened family law up to new questions. Why should marriage only be possible between a man and a woman? Can children have more than two legal parents? What is the extent of the reproductive rights of women and men? Is marriage still a relevant legal concept?  These and other questions are tackled from a comparative law angle, comparing the approach in the United States and other Western jurisdictions. Students are asked to reflect on the various responses to contemporary family law issues across the Western world. The focus is on general tendencies, not on technicalities.  Grades will be based on regular attendance, active class participation and a choice between response papers (Section 01) or a final research paper (Section 02).  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Honors\/Pass\/Restrd Cr\/Fail","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:3"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Public Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"PUBLLAW"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"R -Research Requirement for Law Degree","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"RESEARCH"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO1-Substantive and Procedural Law","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:1"}],"class_id":33444,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"LO3-Ability to Conduct Legal Research.

By the 1990s, social scientists had already built a massive literature on this topic, and an integrative consensus theoretical framework began to emerge.  But in the past decade, this literature has been revitalized by dramatic new ideas and technologies, as well as significant improvements in evaluation methodology.  We will focus on four types of strategies that apply equally to influence efforts by individuals, communities, non-profits, for-profits, and government: (1) Carrots: Positive incentives (rewards, awards, praise, recognition, discounts, rebates, property rights, etc.); (2) Sticks: Negative incentives (punishments, fines, shaming, guilt or liability verdicts, costs, etc.); (3) Norms: What other people believe I should do, and what I see others actually do (tipping points, bandwagons, cascades, herding, etc.); and (4) Nudges: Traditional methods of persuasion; use of defaults to encourage certain behaviors; engineering the environment; harm reduction for risky behaviors.  We will examine the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; and &quot;when&quot; of these approaches, but also their normative implications for ethics, justice, and public welfare.  Course requirements include class attendance and participation, and five short written assignments. For Research &quot;R&quot; credit, students may petition to complete one long paper based on independent research.

We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.

Several sessions of the seminar will consist of an invited speaker, usually from another university, who will discuss his or her current research. Representative of these sessions have been discussions of compensation for government regulations and takings, liability rules for controlling accidents, the definition of markets in antitrust analysis, the role of the government as a controlling shareholder, and optimal drug patent length. Special Instructions: You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a law and economics topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors\/Pass\/Restricted Credit\/Fail basis. (You may write a single longer paper for two quarters if you enroll in the Seminar in the Autumn as well.) Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit, depending on the paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in economics. Students may take both Law and Economics Seminar I and Law and Economics Seminar II in either order (neither is a prerequisite for the other). Elements used in grading: Four commentaries or one research paper. Cross-listed with Economics (ECON 354).

Usually the term applies to analyses of quantitative data and the researcher relies on data collected by others. But the term &quot;empirical&quot; properly encompasses both qualitative and quantitative data, including interviews, legal documents, survey research and experimental results. Analysts interested in using such data need to understand how they were collected, in order to decide what data can appropriately be used to answer different kinds of questions. Often to answer the questions of interest, a researcher needs to collect new data, which poses challenging questions about how to design an empirical research study. Answering these questions appropriately is important to ensure publication in a peer-reviewed journal, which is becoming increasingly important to legal academia. This seminar will introduce students to the wide range of research methods that can be used to answer empirical questions, provide a framework for choosing among methods, and explain how to use the methods. The project for the quarter is to design an empirical research study on a topic of your choice. Special Instructions: JD students can take the class for 3-4 units. SPILS students must take this class for 4 units. Students taking the course for 4 units must attend the additional session on Thursday, which is optional for others. After the term begins, JD students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which can potentially satisfy the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Consent Application for JD students: To apply for this course, JD students must e-mail the instructors for permission to enroll.

Increasingly these systems utilize technology to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency for disputants. In this class we will apply an analytic framework (including stakeholder assessment and conflict resolution process options)  to a series of case studies and use simulations to understand different kinds of dispute systems, while also examining the growing use of online dispute resolution (ODR) and algorithmic approaches in dispute system design. We will review the development of ODR and the new challenges it poses to neutrals and system designers, and try out state-of-the-art ODR technologies, while calling out best practices for the use of technology in dispute system design.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation and Option 1 (section 01) a series of weekly short written assignments plus a 10-page case study; or Option 2 (section 02) weekly short written assignments plus a 26-page research paper involving independent research. Students electing option 2 (section 02) will be graded on the H\/P\/R\/F system and will receive Research (R) credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Negotiation Seminar (LAW 7821) is preferred but not required. The class will meet Wednesday, 4:15-7:15pm on Sept 26, Oct 3, Oct 10, Oct 24 and Saturday, 9-5, on Oct 6 and Nov 3.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments, and final paper. Attendance at the first class is mandatory.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mixed H\/P\/R\/F or MP\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Miscellaneous Practice-Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"MISCPRASKI"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":29897,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":3,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Miscellaneous Practice-Skills.

As the practice of law becomes more complex, it includes more and more situations where groups of people need to work together planning complex legal strategies, developing firm policies, working with corporations or other multi-person clients, or participating in shareholder meetings, public commissions and councils, corporate and non-profit Board of Directors meetings. Group functionality and outcomes can be significantly improved by any group member who has the awareness and skills of a facilitator, whether or not that person is formally designated as the facilitator. The interactive class methodology will combine discussion with many exercises and roleplays, putting facilitation tools into practice every step of the way. We will examine group dynamics and learn skills used by professional facilitators to prevent common problems and elicit the best work of a group. We will explore how to prepare effectively with clear goals, collaborative problem definition, inclusive process design and a well-structured agenda. We will also discuss and practice core meeting management skills such as how to balance voice and participation, build consensus, inspire creativity and promote principled evaluation and decision-making. Finally, we will identify and apply communication skills that keep group sessions productive and tools to manage difficult moments and problem behaviors. Class Schedule dates: Oct. 12th.

Mediation has become the preferred approach to conflict resolution in most states and many parts of the world. With the assistance of a mediator, parties can reach agreements at any stage in a dispute, in some cases avoiding litigation altogether, in other cases agreeing just before trial or when the case is on appeal. The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the oral and written communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to practice all of the phases of a mediation and appropriate use of caucus, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation. The class methodology is highly experiential, with more than half of the class consisting of practice from the perspective of client, advocate and mediator. The course also includes readings and discussions, brief interactive lectures, demonstrations and videotaped sessions. Each student receives individual feedback from an experienced Bay Area mediator and develops skills that will be useful in client development, interviewing, counseling, fact development and legal analysis, negotiation and a variety of contexts beyond mediation. You are encouraged to apply if you have taken (or are concurrently taking) the basic negotiation class or its equivalent in studies or experience.

You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your paralegal, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory (including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact analysis, legal analysis, and collaboration), you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system. The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required. Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the instructor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class. Once you commit to the class, you must complete it or may receive a failing grade. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance and written assignments.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Law Mandatory P\/R\/F","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Miscellaneous Practice-Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"MISCPRASKI"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO6-Law Governing Lawyers\/Ethical Responsibilities","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:6"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO5-Ability to Communicate Orally","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:5"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"EL -Experiential Learning Requirement for Law Deg","name":"LDRQ","schedule_print":true,"value":"EXPLEARN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO4-Ability to Communicate Effectively in Writing","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:4"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO2-Legal Analysis and Reasoning","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:2"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"LO7-Professional Skills","name":"GLAW","schedule_print":true,"value":"LRNOUTCM:7"}],"class_id":34047,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":16,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"This section is limited to 16 SLS students (by Lottery) and 4 non-law students (by consent of instructor).

This hands-on, advanced seminar is designed to teach students how to prepare for, participate in, and critically evaluate complex multiparty negotiations in the public international field. Through experience-based learning and simulations, the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes, including natural resource management and extractive industries, ceasefire negotiations, and peace agreements.  Students will strengthen their written and oral skills, counseling, factual and legal analysis.  Special attention will be paid to the role of mediators and facilitators in such processes. Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar, its substantial academic equivalent, or substantial experience in the field. SPILS students are especially encouraged to enroll. This course is also open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs including International Policy Studies. Please describe prior negotiations coursework and experience on your Consent Form.

This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, coalition management, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems in a community setting, economic development, environmental, public-private, and land use sectors. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze (in terms of law and facts), prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations, including ethical responsibilities to the client and the public, opportunities for leadership, and collaboration. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active preparation and participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a selected case analysis (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue). Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 7821) or its substantial equivalent.

Topics include: taking and defending depositions, trial evidence, including admission of trial exhibits in evidence and use of prior witness statements to refresh and impeach a witness, jury selection and voir dire, opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses, expert witnesses, and closing arguments. Students will try a full jury case through to verdict with use of jurors and usually before a real judge in the courthouse in Palo Alto at the end of the course. Students will also have a chance to watch the jurors deliberate and talk with them after their verdict. The course takes place during seven weeks of the Autumn Quarter with two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 (these usually occur on M, W, or Th), plus the final weekend of jury trials, Saturday and Sunday November 10 and 11. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end before 9:00. For details, please refer to the 2018 Trial Advocacy Workshop Schedule at (TBA). The format for each topic begins with a lecture\/discussion featuring video vignettes of various techniques and a live demonstration by an expert trial lawyer. Following the discussion portion of each topic are small group sessions during which each student practices the skills involved. Constructive feedback is given after each exercise by two of our faculty of very experienced Bay Area litigators and judges. Most exercises are also videoed for further one-on-one critique by another faculty member. The central philosophy of the workshop is that skills are best acquired in an experiential manner by seeing and doing. Frequent short, well-defined exercises followed by immediate constructive feedback in a non-competitive, non-threatening atmosphere provide the core of the program. The workshop directors are Tim Hallahan, Judge Sallie Kim and Sara Peters. Tim has taught similar programs at Harvard Law School, the University of San Francisco School of Law, Berkeley Law, the California Continuing Education of the Bar, and in private and public interest law firms around the country. Sallie is a United States Magistrate Judge in San Francisco and was a partner in a civil litigation firm and also previously taught a class at SLS and served as Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Sara is a trial attorney for a personal injury law firm in San Francisco. She graduated from Stanford Law School in 2008 and coaches the Stanford Law School mock trial team. Special Instructions: If you haven't taken Evidence you must contact Tim Hallahan before the course begins for some brief pre-course reading assignments. There are no papers or tests, but attendance at every session is required. Since we will begin our trial advocacy exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Mandatory attendance. Elements used in grading: Attendance and in-class assignments. In addition, the Trial Advocacy Workshop is approved to offer Experiential Learning (EL) Credit.

They will answer the question: how do we make our social legal systems better for people -- and how do we put people at the center of this redesign? The seminar has two parallel components: (1) Learn from a series of experts who have been taking a community-led approach to remaking a legal system (or analogous ones). Guest experts will present their current case studies to illustrate strategy and process design. (2) Select one of two system redesign challenges (see below) and develop their own prototype launching workshop.  [For those students interested in continuing with the project, there will be a companion policy lab in the Spring Quarter 2018. This seminar is a prerequesite for the policy lab.] The two prospective system-leader partners are on the verge of major new overhauls of their current systems: (a) California Self-Help Services' guardianship\/kid's custody redesign, with Bonnie Hough and the California Judicial Council as a partner, as they try to figure out how to remake the legal system for parents and family members (without lawyers) trying to get custody worked out for kids. (b) New York Chief Justice Task Force housing court\/eviction redesign, with the Chief Judge Janet DiFiore's task force as the partner, as they try to figure out how to make the eviction system work better for users.  Students will develop their own preliminary plan and prototype for a user-centered process for their partner. Students will learn about new approaches to policy-change, as well as the fundamentals of participatory design and community lawyering. They will operationalize these different approaches, to make them relevant and actionable in an actual legal system. They must synthesize a recommendation to their partner-leader about how they might create a better process to redesign a given court process\/system. And they must create a prototype of a launching workshop, that can demonstrate how a wider process would work, while also testing their plan.

The afternoon session offers three hours of instruction focused on designing and evaluating programs to improve individuals' lives (for example programs aimed at reducing homelessness or opioid addiction).

With guidance from their faculty instructors, students may then draw on the skills developed in this introductory seminar to analyze a public policy problem, develop potential strategies to address it, weigh the pros and cons of strategy options, and produce a final product that may offer options or recommendations to a policy client, suggestions for implementing such recommendations, and techniques to assess the effectiveness of implementation.

Program in Corporate Governance &amp; Practice. The course, designed to be taken in conjunction with Corporations in Autumn, takes an economic approach to the analysis of corporate law. In particular, we ask why American corporate law has its particular structure. We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties and shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of a variety of real-life incidents. No knowledge of economics is presupposed, so the course will also introduce basic economics and finance concepts necessary to understand these concepts. Some course sessions, largely in the Winter, will feature outside speakers who will complement the discussions with real-world examples drawn from practice. Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. Students will be required to submit short reflection papers that evaluate, critique, and discuss some or all of the key topics reviewed in the previous week's session. Students may also be asked to prepare presentations to help guide discussions. The class will be graded H\/P\/R\/F in Autumn Quarter and MP\/R\/F in Winter Quarter.

Its main goal is to offer students an interdisciplinary perspective about socio-legal research, and research tools for implementing their individual research projects. This Winter term workshop will complement the Research Design for Empirical Legal Studies Seminar taken in the Autumn by 1) expanding and elaborating on some of the methods analyzed during the seminar; and 2) assisting students in using such methods towards their individual research project. The workshop will consist of specialized sessions, most of them tailored towards the work of empirical research that occurs after the data collection phase. During the quarter the fellows are expected to submit drafts of different chapters of their thesis and present their preliminary findings in class. If appropriate, the workshop may also include group and\/or individual sessions designed to address the very specific needs of the research undertaken by the SPILS Fellows. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments and final presentations. Enrollment is restricted to SPILS fellows.

The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them. As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. In addition, we will delve into some more personal ethical issues that reflect on why students have chosen law as a profession and how lawyers compose careers that promote or frustrate those goals. At the start of each session (starting with the second session) there will be a brief quiz on the material that was covered in the readings and discussion of the prior session. During the period of the course, students will also be responsible for submitting one reflection paper (three-to-five pages) based on a prompt that will be circulated after each of the first six sessions (one paper for the entire course). These papers will be due by 11:59 on the last day the class meets. Grades will be based on the quizzes and the paper submitted, with the instructor retaining the right to take class participation into account. Attendance is mandatory and students must seek instructor approval for any absences not due to illness. This course is offered to foreign graduate students only. It is taught on an accelerated basis over the course of three weeks between orientation and the beginning of the Fall Quarter classes. Thus, the course meets on average nine hours per week. The exact meeting times will be set once the graduate students' schedules are set. Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, quizzes and written memo.

The federal government owns almost a quarter of the United States and almost twice that much of the West, peaking at an astounding 84.9 percent of Nevada.  Since the founding of the Republic, Americans have argued over the best uses and management of the federal public lands--even disagreeing whether the federal government should continue to own them.  These debates have grown more intense under the Trump Administration.  Many of the conflicts focus on the types and intensity of uses to which federal lands should be put.  Should wildlife refuges be open for petroleum development?  Should national parks allow hunting, snowmobiles, and other off-road vehicles?  In other cases, private landowners complain about spillovers from neighboring public lands.  Ranchers in the West, for example, long have complained about federal protection of wolves and wild horses.  These public land debates can be heated and even deadly.  In 2016, armed militants occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to protest federal ownership; the occupation ultimately led to the shooting death of one of the militants.  We will begin at Stanford with several classes on the history and politics of the federal public lands, as well as an evaluation of the competing visions for their use.  We then will travel to Utah to visit key public lands, meet with government officials and stakeholders on all sides of the issues, and study conflicts first hand.  Utah is the perfect state for this intensive field experience.  Outside of Nevada, Utah has the largest percentage of federal public lands (64.9%).  It is home to five magnificent national parks.  Yet Utah also has been home in recent years to a new Sagebrush Rebellion, battling against federal ownership and protection of the public domain.  Utah has been the central focus of President Trump's efforts to reverse the orders of previous presidents who protected large swaths of public lands, including Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, from development by declaring them national monuments.  Students will complete assigned readings on the public lands over the summer.  Once on campus, each student will choose a current public-land controversy to research and analyze.  Students will write 6-8 page papers and present their findings to the class in the last week of the course.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Satisfactory\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"LAWGEN","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"}],"title":"Fighting over Our Common Heritage: Public Lands in the West","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2018-2019"},"506":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"LAW","academic_org":"LAW","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"105Q","course_id":213417,"description":"(Same as AMSTUD 105Q) This seminar focuses on the interface between two important subjects: law and popular culture.

Most businesses don't consider men for women's locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren't those men and women's bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation? After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn't it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people, or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We will answer these and many other questions by looking at court cases, legal theory, and philosophy.

In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.  This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.). The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights; 4) to understand how recent  history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice.
