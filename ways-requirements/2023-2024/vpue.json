But what is the purpose of this journey? Why go to college? Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary,  that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation with more recent works. We will consider the relevance of liberal education to all areas of study, from STEM to the arts, and its relations to future careers. And we will examine the central place that the idea of 'the good life' has historically enjoyed in theories of liberal education. You will be prompted to examine your own life, to question how and why you make decisions, and to argue for your views while respecting those of others. Maybe you will conclude that a liberal education is no longer relevant in the twenty-first century, but we hope that you will do so armed with a thorough understanding of what it has been and what it can be.  In the end, college is less about what you will do in life, than about what kind of person you will be. So: what kind of person do you want to be? What kind of life will you live? Join us as we explore what others have said about these questions and prepare to answer them for yourself.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter

Citizenship also means equal membership in a self-governing political community. We will explore some of the many debates about this ideal: Who is (or ought to be) included in citizenship? Who gets to decide? What responsibilities come with citizenship? Is citizenship analogous to being a friend, a family member, a business partner? How have people excluded from citizenship fought for, and sometimes won, inclusion? These debates have a long history, featuring in some of the earliest recorded philosophy and literature but also animating current political debates in the United States and

progress of LGBTQ+ rights over the last half century has been remarkably swift and absolutely global. Pride parades and marriage rights have become emblems of a  global movement that seems to transcend culture. This course asks what has allowed LGBTQ+  issues to become leading indicators of a certain kind of liberalization and modernization. What is  the road LGBTQ+ rights took from the Stonewall Inn in 1969 to Pride Parades in Minsk, Kolkata  and Nuuk, Greenland by 2015? This course will introduce students to the concepts and issues that have shaped this  development. But it will also highlight the concepts by which historians, social scientists and  political theorists have interrogated the problematic underbelly of this story of global triumph.  What gets left out when we frame the course of LGBTQ+ history as somehow moving from  Lower Manhattan to the rest of the world? Many academics studying LGBTQ+ history worry  about the eurocentrism inherent in this way of telling the story this way, and about how it  truncates our understanding of LGBTQ+ culture. After all, are LGBTQ+ identities and rights one size-fits-all? Do they become a way for Western nations to once again set the standards by  which others are judged developmentally deficient? In certain societies reference to a 'traditional' national way of thinking about gender and  sexuality is simply a fig leaf for homophobia and transphobia. But in other countries an  international vocabulary of LGBTQ+ identity comes face-to-face with longstanding or newly  emergent configurations of gender and sexuality that look very different. How do we mediate  between those two? At the same time, the way Western societies export their conception of  what LGBTQ+ identity is and why and when it matters tells us something about how Western  Europe and the United States think about these issues themselves? What kinds of rights do  Western nations tend to (or at least claim to) champion? Who gets to have and claim those rights?","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"COLLEGE","tags":[{"name":"elective","organization":"SOUTHASIA"},{"name":"southasia","organization":"GLOBAL"}],"title":"Globally Queer","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"8":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"}],"code":"104","course_id":223315,"description":"This course takes a global perspective on the human facets driving meat consumption.

We will draw on examples from Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where systems of social division have been in place for centuries based on the professional relationships of individuals and communities with animal slaughter and butchery. We consider how a range of factors, from religious norms to colonial laws have regulated how meat and animals fit into society often with unexpected results. For instance, attitudes to waste from animal slaughter led to the development of the  abattoir, and ultimately facilitated industrialized meat production.

The course places American democracy in a global and comparative perspective, noting the distinctive features and challenges of U.S. democracy and the wide variety of other democratic institutional forms in the world. It deals both with competing visions of what democracy might be and their actual realization around the world. A major element of the course is to consider different conceptual approaches to democracy-direct, representative, participatory, and deliberative. How do different political systems borrow from these concepts to enhance or justify their forms of governance? How are they evolving or reforming in ways that may address the current crisis of democracy and renew public faith in the efficacy and worth of democracy? Democratic institutions are subject to a living dialogue, and we intend to engage the students in these debates, at the levels of both democratic theory and ongoing democratic practice and institutional designs. In the second half of the course, we will examine innovations like Deliberative Polling and institutional reforms of electoral systems and accountability structures that could increase civic participation, reduce polarization, rein in corruption, and improve the functioning and legitimacy of democracy.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":15449,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"},{"first_name":"Irmak","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Yazici","middle_name":"","name":"Yazici, I.","sunet_id":"irmakyaz"}],"location":"Sweet303","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"1:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"03","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":15451,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"3:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Armando","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Perez-Gea","middle_name":"Jose","name":"Perez-Gea, A.","sunet_id":"perezgea"},{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"}],"location":"Econ 218","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"05","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":15450,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":7,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Armando","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Perez-Gea","middle_name":"Jose","name":"Perez-Gea, A.","sunet_id":"perezgea"},{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"}],"location":"160-328","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"5:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"04","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":15427,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":45,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":60,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Larry","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Diamond","middle_name":"","name":"Diamond, L.","sunet_id":"ldiamond"},{"first_name":"James","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Fishkin","middle_name":"","name":"Fishkin, J.","sunet_id":"jfishkin"}],"location":"200-203","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"10:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"4"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"class_id":15428,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dayo","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Mitchell","middle_name":"","name":"Mitchell, D.","sunet_id":"dayom"},{"first_name":"Irmak","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Yazici","middle_name":"","name":"Yazici, I.","sunet_id":"irmakyaz"}],"location":"Sweet303","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"12:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":""}],"subject":"COLLEGE","tags":[{"name":"comp_gov","organization":"IR"},{"name":"Democracy","organization":"DRUPALTEST"}],"title":"The Spirit of Democracy","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"15":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"}],"code":"111","course_id":224013,"description":"Climate change is now a global crisis.

Fortunately, governments and the fossil fuel industry that still holds undue influence over them are not the only entities that will determine whether humanity can survive on the only planet in the universe known so far to support life. Thanks to massive global activism, especially among youth and people on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and a revolution in ever more affordable and scalable clean energy, especially solar,

live immersed in technology but are perplexed by deep uncertainties about where technology is taking us - to a dead end or a better place? Technology has helped create utopian visions of good society while plunging societies into dystopic nightmares. Science and technology have been a universal path for all societies to join the modern world, but different cultures think about them differently. The Enlightenment ofthe West conceives scientific modernity as emancipation from religion and superstition and as a power over nature. In contrast, the traditional Chinese worldviews incorporate technology into a sacred cosmos where humans use science and technology to stay in tune with Heaven and Earth. Today, technoscience discourse has become a dominant power and ideology. Technoscientific agendas are generating class disparity,eroding the social fabric, undermining the humanist traditions, and damaging nature and climate. Science fiction thinks about how science and technology transform human society, values, and everyday experiences in ways good or bad. By projecting both utopia and dystopia, sf reveals and critiques technology-induced social malaises and keeps hopes alive by projecting better futures, testifying to the ceaseless human potential for self-renewal in sustaining civilization on Earth. This course asks the two-fold question: How can humans of diverse cultures harness technoscientific innovations while preserving humanist values and maintain a sustainable economy and civilization? How do narratives of utopia and dystopia depict the anthropocentric domination of nature and the exploitation working classes through themisuse and abuse of technology? Two evening film screenings required.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter

course explores an array of early thought and practices in East Asia that had lasting impact--down to today. The focus is on foundational texts, systems of belief, and the arts (music, calligraphy, painting). In one way or another, these were primarily concerned with discovering and propagating a certain Way (Dao) that was believed to embody cosmic principles and be essential to a good life and a harmonious society. But there was plenty of disagreement about what the Way was, where to look for it, and how best to practice it in daily life. We concentrate on cultural values in ancient China that became intrinsic there and were later transported throughout East Asia (Korea, Japan) and even to Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.). Since antiquity, Chinese thinking grappled with the question of how society should be ordered and what if any model should be adopted to achieve social harmony. A range of rival philosophical and religious systems emerged. Later, people who were not satisfied with any one of these extended their inquiries into other areas of human endeavor, especially in the literary, musical, and visual arts, discovering that these could embody their own Way that led to a fulfilling life. We will give attention to all of these alternative understandings of the Way, which collectively account for many of the distinctive traits of culture and history in East Asia.","final_exam":false,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34481,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":17,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"On Mondays students meet in their own course, and on Wednesdays COLLEGE 114, 115 and 116 all meet together in 380-380X.","schedules":[{"days":["Monday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ronald","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Egan","middle_name":"","name":"Egan, R.","sunet_id":"ronegan"},{"first_name":"Sijia","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Li","middle_name":"","name":"Li, S.","sunet_id":"lisj0626"}],"location":"100-101K","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"},{"days":["Wednesday"],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ronald","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Egan","middle_name":"","name":"Egan, R.","sunet_id":"ronegan"},{"first_name":"Sijia","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Li","middle_name":"","name":"Li, S.","sunet_id":"lisj0626"}],"location":"Departmental Room","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":"11:30:00 AM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"3"}],"subject":"COLLEGE","tags":[{"name":"cc-ff","organization":"VPUE"}],"title":"Looking for the Dao in East Asia","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"19":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"}],"code":"115","course_id":225560,"description":"Ancient Greek and Roman texts have long been regarded as the touchstones of Western culture.

Not only do these texts reward attentive reading, but for much of Western history, their knowledge was considered essential for an education.

What is the role of gender, religion, race\/ethnicity, language or geography in creating group identity? In what ways are such social identities determined by a sense of the past, whether we call it history, mythology, tradition or collective memory? (d) What role do different media - whether written, spoken, otherwise performed, or visual - play in conveying a sense of the past from one generation to another? In the course of our readings and analysis we shall question the very nature of literature in relation to non-written media, the coherence of supposed traditions, and the usefulness of rubrics such as collective memory.

From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society.

This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen or the German Tradition of Bildung.","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2023-2024"},"25":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"3","course_id":214534,"description":"Can education impart more than bookish learning?

Though the slave is perhaps the extreme case, many people, it seems, fail to recognize the full range of possibilities open to them. In this course, we shall examine both some of the ways in which one&iquest;s capacity for self-recognition may be distorted and undermined and the role of education in enabling a person to fully recognize the self and its possibilities.  What constrains the range of possibilities we see as really open to us? Contrary to the Cartesian, we shall argue that full self-recognition is an often a hard-won achievement.  And we shall ask how education might function to give us a less constricted and more liberating sense of the self and its possibilities. We will consider such questions through the lens of philosophy, literature and psychology.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-ER","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"recognize the frameworks for thought and action implicit in human practices, and analyze the different assumptions underpinning those frameworks."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"identify, understand, and use multiple normative concepts and arguments."},{"code":"WAY-ER","description":"evaluate competing ethical perspectives on human problems and action."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"ESF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Education as Self-Fashioning: Recognizing the Self and Its Possibilities","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2023-2024"},"33":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"College","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"COL"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"9","course_id":216668,"description":"In this class we explore thinking about the self and its cultivation that took root and flourished in China.

In this course we will ponder such questions as we reflect critically on human nature and on historical and contemporary ideas regarding education, self-development, and living well.","final_exam":true,"gers":["College","THINK","WAY-A-II","Writing 1"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":7,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28141,"component":"DIS","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Rebecca","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Richardson","middle_name":"","name":"Richardson, R.","sunet_id":"beckyr"}],"location":"160-318","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":"3:30:00 PM"}],"section_num":"02","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":""},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28142,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":14,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":15,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"All ESF students must also participate in the mandatory Friday plenary session (ESF 50), 12:30pm-1:20pm.","schedules":[{"days":["Friday"],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Sarah","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Prodan","middle_name":"Rolfe","name":"Prodan, S.","sunet_id":"sprodan"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":"12:30:00 PM"},{"days":["Tuesday"],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[{"first_name":"Sarah","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Prodan","middle_name":"Rolfe","name":"Prodan, S.","sunet_id":"sprodan"}],"location":"Thornton 207","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":"3:00:00 PM"}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"7"}],"subject":"ESF","tags":[],"title":"Between Gods and Beasts: The Struggle for Humanity","units_max":7,"units_min":7,"year":"2023-2024"},"53":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Writing 1 Requirement","name":"UGRQ","schedule_print":false,"value":"WR1"}],"code":"19","course_id":222347,"description":"This course is an exploration of a genre of writing crafted by exceptional figures from marginalized communities in modern India to articulate their pain, protest, anger and analyses: the memoir or the autobiography.  nInstead of reading conventional historical accounts, in this course we will chart an alternative narrative of modern India, one that emerges in the memoirs of those victimized by the oppressive structures of caste, capitalism and heteronormative patriarchy.

Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work. In advance of each conversation, students will read about something written by the scholar\/critic about the artist. Each artist will also design a short art-making prompt for enrolled students to complete and share through the course website. Students will share their artworks weekly in small critique groups.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":2,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"appreciate the nature of human responses to meaningful cultural objects, and distinguish among the different methods to interpret those responses."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand how expressive works articulate responses to fundamental human problems and convey important values."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":15805,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"This class may be taken for 1 or 2 units.

Most university courses in the history of the arts are divided either by geography or time period, as well as artistic discipline. But these simple distinctions are not natural to the production or reception of art itself. Although it might be easy to assume that art is made out of materials close at hand and seen or experienced chiefly by local makers, artists have often sought out distant materials and unfamiliar ideas, which are prized for their scarcity or their very distance from what is local and familiar. Historically these movements have revealed global power structures, as well as local interest and agency in ways that can be both far reaching and narrowly focused. Globalization is commonly equated with contemporary multinational corporations, from Apple to Amazon to AliExpress, but earlier periods of global exchange have also materially shaped what art is and can be. Art can reflect and reveal a global movement of peoples and ideas, as well as the raw materials that make art possible - whether words, woods, animals, minerals or melodies. We will focus in this class on a series of case studies that explore how art moves - and why these movements move artists and the people who are influenced by their work. Lectures will feature scholars and artists who address aspects of global exchange or movement in their work. In a series of workshops, students will work towards creating a genealogical project that similarly investigates how origins and movement have enabled and inspired art-making.

How do China's political institutions affect its economy? What are the most credible explanations for China's economic rise? What current challenges will shape China's future?  To address these questions, we will trace the evolution of China's economy from the days of its modified Soviet-style system to the present state-directed market economy. We will specify how China's trajectory compares with other countries that have departed from the previous visions of state socialism, as well as economies in East Asia that have also experienced &quot;miracle&quot; growth. We will consider widely discussed limits of the Chinese model and problems that must be solved in the coming years. Along the way we will look closely at the engine that has driven China's growth, and the ways that China differs from almost all other major economies. We will also examine trends in inequality, demographic change, and educational expansion that may create constraints on China's future development.

The approach examines what BRI is in theory and in practice, to understand how BRI has played out in different countries and different sectors over time.  Specific questions addressed will include: What are the claims that have been made about BRI?  What is the political and economic logic of BRI?  Who are the key players?  How much of this is controlled and coordinated by Beijing?  How much by local authorities?  What bureaucratic structures, if any, have been created to regulate this major initiative?  Whose interests are being served with BRI?  What are the challenges facing BRI?  How have strategies evolved?  How have international reactions affected China's globalization strategies?  How has this affected US-China Relations?  How does BRI affect domestic politics? Because of the complexity and likely variation in how BRI works in practice across different projects and countries, students will research a specific country or project that is part of BRI.  To cover diverse aspects of the country in more depth students will form small research groups.  To facilitate research, we will provide links to various databases useful for research on BRI.

Even previously closed-off China had chosen the path of economic liberalization and some political reform. It seemed like the whole world wanted to become a democracy and join the democratic community of states. Today, great power competition is back with many describing our present era as a &quot;New Cold War&quot; between the United States and China. How did the international system go from euphoria about democracy, globalization, the West, and the United States three decades ago, to uncertainty about democracy, doubt about the liberal international order, and fear about the rise of illiberal great powers? Moreover, is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy, and how stable or enduring is this current moment of global confrontation? This course seeks to analyze contemporary U.S.-China relations. We will begin by reviewing the major theories in IR, from both Western and Chinese scholars. Then, in our second session, we will study the historical origins of U.S.-China relations, examining the interplay between three central drivers of international relations ? power, regime types, and leaders ? over time. The third part of the course will focus on assessing the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions of the international system: (1) power, (2) ideology, and (3) competing conceptions of global order. The fourth and final part of the course will discuss a set of concrete policy recommendations for how U.S. leaders can (and should) meet the challenge of great power competition in the 21st century. The main text for this course will be the draft of Professor McFaul's upcoming book, tentatively called Great Power Competition in the 21st Century: Lessons from the Cold War for Competing with China and Russia Today, as well as accompanying academic books and articles.

Scholars today debate the meaning of &quot;genocide&quot; ? a term first coined in 1944 ? but even by the strictest definition the last century has witnessed at least half a dozen.  It has also seen &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; (another recent coinage), the systematic use of rape as a political weapon, a burgeoning international slave trade, a steady erosion of the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, and any number of other grievous crimes.  We live in an age of atrocity.  Yet our era has also seen the development of new modalities for identifying, combatting, and redressing the effects of such crimes.  So accustomed have we become to war crimes tribunals, truth and reconciliation commissions, national and institutional apologies, reparations program, and the creation of atrocity museums and memorials that it is easy to forget how novel such things are.  To be sure, this emerging international reparative regime has rarely, if ever, fulfilled the ambitions of its architects, but it has ensured a measure of justice for at least some perpetrators of great crimes and a modicum of redress for at least some of their victims.  Equally important, it has created an array of precedents and institutional forms for societies seeking to come to terms with gross historical injustice and its legacies. This seminar will survey the emerging field of &quot;retrospective justice&quot; through a series of topical readings and case studies.  Topics include:  the invention of &quot;genocide&quot;; war crimes tribunals; truth commissions; the politics of official apologies; monetary reparations programs; and the art, architecture, and politics of public memorials.  Specific cases range from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the ongoing efforts of American universities to come to terms with their historical sins, but in keeping with our location we will spend the lion's share of our time looking at the German case. focusing not simply on the Holocaust but also on the Nuremberg Tribunal that followed, the &quot;forgotten&quot; extermination of Herero and Nama people in German South-West Africa in the years between 1904-07, and the strange career of Hitler's architect, Albert Speer.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":33514,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"  This class section has been cancelled!","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"3"},{"attributes":[],"class_id":34250,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":10,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"James","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Campbell","middle_name":"T.","name":"Campbell, J.","sunet_id":"jtcampb"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 8, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPBER","tags":[],"title":"History, Memory, and Trauma: Confronting The Past in Historically Divided Societies","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"137":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGBERL","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"}],"code":"24B","course_id":216760,"description":"Structured help to review and improve German language skills for participants of the Bing Overseas Studies program in Berlin.

The syllabus will be tailored to any relevant cultural events in Berlin and neighboring cities planned for the quarter in question.

How does music perpetuate, but also challenge, broader inequalities? Why do some songs become hits? What effects are technology and digital media having on the ways we experience and think about music? Course readings and lectures will explore the various answers to these questions by introducing students to key concepts and ideas. Class time will be spent moving between core theories, listening sessions, discussion of current musical events, and an interrogation of students' own musical experiences.

War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five core questions: Why do states go to war and what could be the basis for a lasting peace? If war is unavoidable, what is the role of morality in war?

A few months later, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch provided the theoretical basis for understanding the perplexing experimental results by Hahn and Strassmann and named the process fission. Their discovery, and the fear that Germany was developing nuclear weapons, was the motivation for the U.S. Manhattan Project that lead to the development of and first use of nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Germany, in fact, had its own Uranprojekt and Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor) projects lead by Werner Heisenberg, a leading physicist at that time, but failed to develop a nuclear weapon.

Drawing on discourses in Body politics, feminist theories of health and medical anthropological approaches to research, this seminar series seeks to question and explore the nature of health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Essentially, it provides an intersectional exploration into how health is comparatively conceptualised using anthropology as the model of analysis.  The series is presented discursively and students' lived-experience and critical reflections are welcomed. Topics covered in the course include anthropological configurations of  'the body' (including phenomenology and biopower) as well as the history and geography of medicine (something of a broad sweep of the impact of European medicinal encounters in Africa). The theoretical approach adopted will consider postcolonial theory, development theory, and feminist theories to unpack health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Typical to studies in health and well-being, the seminar series is interdisciplinary in its delivery and students are encouraged to engage critically with a broad range of literature and texts in order to grapple with the content. Thus, there are no prerequisites for doing the course and we welcome students with varying majors.

While professional historians have long-established methodologies for writing about the past, history is continuously explored by people removed from the academy and uninterested in engaging with many of the historiographical and methodological issues that concern scholars. Put another way, many people think about, relate to, and recreate the past in ways that lack footnotes, citations, and sometimes even words. The course has two main components. First, we will consider how aspects of African history have been treated by non-academics from various walks of life, including artists, writers, archivists, photographers, and engaged citizens. In this aspect of the class, Cape Town will be our laboratory; we will take multiple field trips to museums, historical sites, archives, and other relevant exhibitions. If possible, we will schedule meetings with people working to bring the past to life, either through museum work, archival projects, or artistic expression. Approaches will include graphic histories, creative non-fiction, oral histories, art installations, performance and reenactments, and sites of memory, such as museums. Much of our class discussion will be structured around experiencing, critiquing, and understanding the methods used to produce these reflections on the past. We will assess, through weekly exposure to examples, what works, how it works, what doesn't work, and why. But the course is also essentially a creative and research-oriented endeavor. Our analysis of others' works of exhibitions, art, and documentary is undertaken in the service of thinking about students' own projects. Run essentially as a workshop, the latter part of the course will help students develop and create their own reflections on aspects of African history, memory, or the past. Throughout the course, students will start to develop both a subject and a method to capture a historical experience, event, or episode in a way that allows them to express effectively its import ? emotional, political, personal, or otherwise ? for the present. Along the way, students will be expected to help lead discussions, produce short assignments, and make presentations on the development of their project. The main goal of the class, though, will be the production of a final project ? an innovative work of history, a personal and engaging reflection on the past.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":33346,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":16,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"James","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Daughton","middle_name":"P.","name":"Daughton, J.","sunet_id":"daughton"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPCPTWN","tags":[],"title":"Reimagining Histories of Africa: A Workshop","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"187":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGCAPE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"30","course_id":217754,"description":"This compulsory course provides a brief introduction to social issues in contemporary South Africa.

The work of these Italians contributed to the rise of the scientific method, the development of modern sciences (especially astronomy, biology, physics, and mathematics), and the study of human anatomy and medicine. Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers.

In-class discussions, informed by the readings assigned for the day, will focus on the contemporary endurance and importance of what made Florence renowned in the medieval and early Modern times: politics, trade, religion, family allegiance, civic pride, and the crucial role played by foreigners and immigrants.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":1,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":15082,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":45,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":50,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Vigotti","middle_name":"","name":"Vigotti, L.","sunet_id":"vigotti"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"1"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":15825,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":45,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":50,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Vigotti","middle_name":"","name":"Vigotti, L.","sunet_id":"vigotti"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 8, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"1"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":15316,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":44,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Vigotti","middle_name":"","name":"Vigotti, L.","sunet_id":"vigotti"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"1"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"european","organization":"SGS"},{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"ihc","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Italy through the Florentine Piazzas","units_max":1,"units_min":1,"year":"2023-2024"},"211":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"15M","course_id":222155,"description":"Musicians coming to Florence who wish to continue their study can do so with private instructors at the Accademia del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.

This course explores the history, culture, and contemporary politics of Italy through the lens of the country's relations with Muslims and Islamic societies in the Mediterranean region. We begin in the first millennium of the common era, when Muslims ruled over large parts of Europe, including Iberia and Sicily. We then move into the Renaissance period to cover Italy's extensive relations with Islamic empires such as the Mamluks of Egypt and the Ottomans of the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa (often simply called, &quot;the Turks&quot;). Moving into the modern period, we will then examine how Italian national identity was moulded in contrast to an imagined Muslim counterpart, tracing how these ideas informed Italian colonialism in North Africa. The last part of the course focuses on contemporary issues: over the past several decades and still today, Italy has maintained particularly close relations with Muslim countries in the region. Nonetheless, immigration and the supposed menace of Islam have come to play a large role in Italian politics today. We will study these topics using a range of sources including first-hand accounts (in translation), art, and film. Key themes in the course include conquest, coexistence, conversion, migration &amp; immigration, trade, colonialism, national identity formation, the Cold War, and global political movements.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":32969,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":12,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":50,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Ali","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Karamustafa","middle_name":"Aydin","name":"Karamustafa, A.","sunet_id":"aakaramu"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 8, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"3"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"HISTORY","organization":"ISSTUD"},{"name":"ihc","organization":"IR"},{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"meca","organization":"IR"},{"name":"histw12","organization":"ISSTUD"}],"title":"\"Oh no - the Turks!\": Italy and the Islamic Mediterranean","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"215":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"21F","course_id":202547,"description":"Review of grammatical structures; grammar in its communicative context.

The classes will be inspired by current methodologies, linked to a tradition interested in the objecthood of artistic creation and the relationship between stylistic choices and the limitations of technologies. The collections of the Florentine museums and the city's extraordinary heritage, will allow direct contact with the works we will discuss in class. Proximity will also make it possible to gain knowledge about places of production and procurement of materials (the Carrara quarries, the ancient casting places, for example). This approach will not only problematize fundamental issues pertaining to the very concept of the &quot;artisticness&quot; of an artifact, but-in following a chronological span-will reflect on the periodization of formal languages characterizing the early modern era, at the same time confronting topics relevant to the current historiographical debate. Such investigations, in addition to offering an updated and problematic look at some of the most iconic figurative texts for the art-historical discussion about early modern period (from Donatello's David to Michelangelo's, via masterpieces by artists such as Luca della Robbia, Benvenuto Cellini and Giambologna), will provide students with useful paraphernalia for confronting canonized and, so to speak, sacralized figurative testimonies, putting into context the drives and motives, the conditioning and expectations behind their very creation.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28496,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":31,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Tommaso","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Mozzati","middle_name":"Giovanni","name":"Mozzati, T.","sunet_id":"tmozzati"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"minor","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"interdisguide","organization":"ARTINST"},{"name":"ccguide","organization":"ARTINST"}],"title":"Sculpting the Renaissance: Aesthetics, Materials & Innovation","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"220":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"26","course_id":216909,"description":"Discussion and analysis of the European Crisis, which started in Greece in 2009 and continues.

When did we start considering human beings as inhabitants of the sky? When were women involved in both imaginary and real astronomical journeys? How did the idea of celestial travel change over the last four centuries and how did the intertwinement of artistic and scientific artifacts contribute to the rise of new images of the universe? Which scientific discoveries led astronomers to wonder about the habitability conditions of planets in and beyond the solar system?

By focusing on the scientific methods, material, and theoretical tools adopted by Italian philosophers and astronomers, students will gain a better understanding of the other worlds in the universe: from the Renaissance new definition of the Earth-Moon system and Galileo's methodological and epistemological reflections to Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations and debates on the so-called canals on Mars. They will explore the different methods and arguments employed to state the ontological homogeneity of space by referring to textual and visual documents, as well as material artifacts. Furthermore, they will gain knowledge of the aesthetic and theoretical underpinnings underlying the creation or improvement of scientific instruments to observe, investigate, and represent new images of the universe, as well as the machines designed to undertake the first real or imaginary travels in the sky and to the Moon.

If traditional conceptualizations of the Florentine Renaissance described it as the rebirth of naturalism, which set the canon of Western classicism, recent critical voices have revealed the tensions, ruptures, and erosions that were active underneath that surface, with profound consequences on artmaking and the world of images. Building on such debate, through direct experience and close observation of the context, these classes will propose a different narrative of mainstream Renaissance Florence. By looking with fresh eyes to painted, sculpted, and architectural works, they will reframe early modern Florentine art as a profoundly polyphonic one, which sheds light on many unsettling aspects of modernity: materialism, and the germs of historical pessimism; technology and capitalist modes of production; the fragility of nature; sensuality, tactility, and the private life of objects; the otherness of uncanny bodies; religious tensions as the expression of the individual's anxiety; the colonial appropriation of a newly expanded world. With an interest for the contaminated and the intermediate, by privileging continuities over oppositions, the course will thus offer a new understanding of the period in order to deconstruct any elitist interpretation and instead reveal its lively, diverse nature.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34001,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":28,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":45,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Florence only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Dario","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Donetti","middle_name":"","name":"Donetti, D.","sunet_id":"ddonetti"},{"first_name":"Ermelinda","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Campani","middle_name":"M.","name":"Campani, E.","sunet_id":"campani"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"4"}],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[],"title":"Rinascimento conteso: Florence's Early Modern Art Reframed","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"250":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"62","course_id":224231,"description":"Fashion and garment production is an old trade, and it is one of Italy's most important sectors in terms of global prestige, cultural effervescence, and exportation. Fashion entangles creativity, culture, style, and ways of life. At the same time, garment production entails complex and globalized manufacturing processes that tie together segmented labor forces with differentiated levels of work quality, rights, and regions embedded in the world economy in diverse positions and at different levels of their developmental path. Garment manufacturing is an industry forerunner in terms of productive globalization, and it is considered a starter industrial sector for economically underdeveloped regions. Early on, it presented signs of technological revolutions, the growing role of intangible assets over production, and the restructuring dynamics of production in complex, globalized and functionally integrated value chains. The sector, therefore, serves as a guide and a lens to scrutinize wide-ranging phenomena and to engage with broader theoretical debates. By analyzing the garment\/fashion complex, it is possible to study globalizing production and consumption processes, the role of decent work in global production networks, and the crucial issues of economic development and transnational regulations. This course focuses on the literature that deals with garment production in Global Value Chains and explores different analytical approaches in between the theoretical traditions of economic and labor sociology and international political economy. The focus on garments allows students to deepen their knowledge of related and wider issues such as theories of development, feminist political economy, analyses of labor organizations, and the regulations for decent work across national boundaries. The course, therefore, touches upon issues of gendered exploitative mechanisms at work, labor control and surveillance, theories of labor agency and movements within the workplace and across national boundaries, as well as theories of private and public global governance for labor standards. While the course is global in its analytical scope, it pays specific attention to European and especially Italian dynamics. Readings on Italian case studies and current events are presented in almost all the weekly topics and two thematic units are dedicated entirely to an analysis of garment production processes in Prato and in Southern Italy.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-EDP","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[],"title":"Un)fashionable Entanglements: Development, Workers' Movements and Regulation in Global Garment Value","units_max":5,"units_min":5,"year":"2023-2024"},"251":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"64","course_id":221279,"description":"Analysis of colonialism during the 19th century, with particular reference to French colonialism, followed by discussion of the influence of the colonial heritage on current African and Euro-Mediterranean relations.

From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to glory; Boccaccio's love, so sensual and yet so deeply rooted in the human soul as to cause the greatest joy or the deepest despair; Ariosto's love, a dangerous force that can drive people to madness in a world where, after all, everyone is somehow in love and therefore partly (and delightfully) crazy; Machiavelli's love, which can sharpen one's wits and bring with it great achievements, unless it clouds one's judgement and leads to failure; Aretino's love, so unabashedly physical and graphically explicit as to cause scandal and amazement all over Europe. We will also look at how love is described by Veronica Gambara, Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa and other women poets of the Renaissance who renewed the lyrical code from within, giving new meanings to old words. We will also listen to the various kinds of love put to music in operas from Don Giovanni to Traviata and Boh&egrave;me, and we will investigate how love interrelates with history in Manzoni's Promessi sposi and other Romantic historical novels. Finally, we will explore how the previous (male) narratives about love were reconfigured and reinvented by female novelists of the 20th century such as Goliarda Sapienza, Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante, who will lead us to delve into Elena Ferrante's works, where love constantly interplays with friendship, and often confirms that, for better or for worse, appearances can be deceiving.

Our entry point will be Cesare Beccaria's 1764 treatise, Of Crimes and Punishments, which linked criminal justice reform with the struggle against despotism. Beccaria was a key figure in the Italian Enlightenment, and his treatise laid the foundation for virtually all subsequent efforts at criminal justice reform, in the United States as well as in Europe. Beccaria's ideas heavily influenced the American Revolutionaries, found expression in the Bill of Rights, and continue to shape discussions of policing and punishment today. We will read Beccaria's treatise, as well as secondary materials placing him in historical context and tracing his influence on the reform of criminal justice institutions in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We will also examine a series of contemporary debates about policing, prosecution, and punishment, including calls for prison abolition and for defunding the police, and we will ask what light Beccaria's ideas can throw on those debates.  We will consider, too, the criminal-justice dimensions of the recent rise of populism and nativism, both in the United States and in Europe, and the increasing overlap between debates about crime and debates about immigration. Studying Beccaria will provide a window into the Italian Enlightenment, and tracing his influence will help us place modern debates about mass incarceration, police violence, and prosecutorial discretion in historical perspective. We may take field trips to the sites of former prisons in Florence and to Milan, where Beccaria lived and worked.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPFLOR","tags":[{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"comp_gov","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Policing, Punishment and Democracy: Beccaria and the Modern Politics of Crime","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"274":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGFLOR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"code":"111Y","course_id":108213,"description":"Lectures, site visits, and readings reconstruct the circumstances that favored the flowering of architecture, sculpture, and painting in Florence and Italy, late 13th to early 16th century.

These changes were in response to the self-strengthening demands of young revolutionaries after decades of war and national humiliation. Over several decades, Chinese writers experimented with Western literary genres, including realism, romanticism, imagism, modernism, critical realism, magical realism, postmodernism, and so on. Chinese writers constantly probed the issue of literary modernity and attempted to redefine China and Chineseness by incorporating Western influences into classical Chinese aesthetics. This class explores Chinese literary tradition in the twentieth century and early twenty first century through fiction (novels, short stories, poetry, etc.) and films from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland China. Major themes we will discuss include socio-political reformation, gender relations, urban space, the environment, and individual subjectivity. Creatively engaging with Western influences and classical literary traditions, Chinese writers and filmmakers we examine showcase how the Chinese reconstructed modern literature in relation to China's nation-building process.

Much of this involves contestations over China's historical past and Maoist legacies for the future that both are primarily concerned with politics in the present. Historians, meantime, are more deeply engaged than ever before in seeking to advance our understanding of how this era and its events emerged and developed as they did, and what its consequences have been for China today. The quest to illuminate the historical processes contributing to this era of turbulent elite politics, chaotic and often horrifically violent revolutionary political campaigns, and unprecedentedly vast state-directed restructuring of the economy, culture, and nearly all aspects of society has been joined by an interest in the related human and natural costs, the lived experiences, and the diverse forms in which local societies at the grassroots distant from the central government adapted their own variations of life under Chinese socialism.

Since embarking on its reform andopening-up policy in 1978, China has transformed from a command economy to a market-orientedsystem and achieved over three decades of rapid growth. Chinese society has also undergone an allencompassing socio-cultural change, from a proletarian culture in the Mao era to a burgeoningconsumer culture today. This course will address both the historical processes of cultural changes andmajor consumer issues in contemporary China. It aims to provide a roadmap for students to develop acritical perspective on China's consumer culture. In essence, the class explores what it means tobelong to a consumer society with &quot;Chinese characteristics&quot;. We will start by introducing core concerns,arguments, and approaches related to consumer culture in China. After the introductory sessions, wewill focus, week by week, on common (and oftentimes controversial) consumer issues we encounterin our daily lives. We will read works covering various consumption experiences while paying specialattention to how consumer culture, embedded in the specific economic, political and socio-culturalmilieu of contemporary China constructs our ways of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot;. We will also look into thedetrimental aspects of consumer culture, including its psychological and ethical impacts, class andgender exploitation, and environmental degradation.

The course traces the development of cultural and creative industries in both the academic field and the industry world. Using cultural studies theories as the backdrop, the course investigates issues related to the CCI that intersect culture, economy, technology and industry. Unlike typical cultural studies curriculum that emphasizes on critical scholarship in the cultural field, this course incorporates critical curriculum into the areas of business culture and financial management in transnational cultural corporations. The course investigates the marketing aspects of cultural and creative industries both within Asia and Hong Kong. It contains three parts in order to provide comprehensive overview of the CCI field. The course first begins with an introduction of the basic constitution of the CCI in Hong Kong. This understanding of Hong Kong's CCI sets up the main perspective as the course continues to discuss the historical development of cultural and creative industries in other parts of the world. The second section of the course covers important topics relevant to the CCI at the theoretical level. The topics include critical history and definition, cultural and creative industry theories and emerging themes in the CCI. Weekly discussion covers industry issues such as production, consumption, market, place, value chain, informal economy and digital distribution. The course also covers management curriculum as students learn concepts such as creative management, digital disruption, cultural entrepreneurship, technological innovation and strategy planning in social media environment. The third section of the course includes practical case studies, which require students to focus on specific cultural products, commercial art works and performing art shows in Hong Kong, China and Asia. The ultimate goal of this course is to encourage students to develop creative entrepreneurship based upon cultural and industry knowledge learnt in this course.

In 2022, there were over 360 million online daters worldwide. This course provides an interdisciplinary approach to look into one of the latest and most widely discussed online cultures - online dating and hookups. Departing from the public health approach that focuses exclusively on sexually transmitted diseases via the use of online dating platforms, this course examines the communicative, technological, and social aspects of online dating and hookup culture. Topics include online relationship development, motivations of app use, app design, gender politics, and queer world-making. Cases will be drawn from different regions. Students will be invited to design their own dating apps, compare courtship practices on and off the apps, and play the role of app administrators. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify the opportunities and challenges dating and hookup apps bring to different groups of users and take up a responsible mindset when using online dating platforms.

Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object &quot;to-be-looked-at&quot;, ? in Laura Mulvey's now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of &quot;women's pictures&quot; and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women's lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more. Mulvey's groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films &quot;cut to the measure of [male] desire.&quot; Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

It perceives gender as an analytical category that continues to be shaped and reshaped as part of our everyday realities. Thus, this course is not about women's participation in formal political mechanisms. It considers femininities and masculinities together and conceptualizes politics outside of formal political procedures. The course is divided into three parts. During the first few weeks we begin by reviewing some of the processes through which gender has been constructed and how it can be used today as an analytical category. We specifically investigate complex notions such as gender, sex, femininity, masculinity, intersectionality and apply them to our understanding of politics, political economy and power.  In the second and third parts of the course we use this foundation to explore various intersectional inequalities that govern everyday lives. We revisit various issues of everyday politics and political economy from the perspective of often invisibilized experiences. We analyze a number of contemporary institutions, discourses and practices through themes of nations and states, ideologies of citizenship, labor practices and processes, development, economic globalization and international governance.

We will analyse the ways in which historians and anthropologists have used the Mediterranean as a privileged terrain to rethink the communication, circulation and exchanges between the Christian and Muslim worlds, often represented as fundamentally antagonistic.  Although violence is pervasive in the Middle Sea's history, we will see that it was not always religiously motivated. We will thus explore other forms of tension such as wars between empires aspiring for global dominion (Spain and the Ottoman Empire), privateering, the exploitation of captive labour force, slave trade and the wars of colonial conquest. A theatre of multiform conflicts, the Mediterranean was also a crossroads where economic, commercial and political interests intersected. We will thus examine the ways in which these interactions contributed to the formation of multi-religious states and favoured religious syncretism and linguistic and cultural hybridizations. We will finally investigate how nationalism and colonialism compartmentalized the Mediterranean space. Aside from scholarly works, our material will include literature and films.

What is &quot;Islamic culture&quot;? How does it relate to &quot;Classical Islamic Thought&quot;? When did it come to be, and how? What were its contributions to human societies over time? Which authors, texts and ideas played a leading role in shaping this story?  What do we mean when we speak of Islam as a 'tradition'? What forms of being and knowing does this evoke and promote? How did historical contexts in the lands conquered by Muslims since the middle of the 7th century impact the intercultural transmission of knowledge in the medieval Mediterranean world? And what lasting legacies does this have in our contemporary modern world? How does this history support or confront the multitude of strong and often conflicting opinions about Islam (and indeed religion more broadly) prevalent in our day? Indeed, how might studying the past inform our present? ?  These are just some of the questions that loom behind the subject of this course. The aim is to begin unpacking some of these issues by providing a general survey of Islamic intellectual history focusing on what has been called the 'Classical Period' (the 7th century to c. 1258).  Covering topics in theology, history, philosophy, mysticism, and ethics the course introduces students to some of the key themes, texts, authors, and debates in the Islamic tradition, and how they have been approached in the scholarly literature.  By resituating Islam within the broader world of Late Antiquity, the course also attempts to highlight points of interaction, convergence and divergence with neighbouring religious and intellectual traditions (Hellenic, Ancient Near Eastern, Jewish, Christian etc.) that have historically shaped the parameters of the Islamic intellectual tradition in this period.  Students are encouraged to engage individually and collectively with the assigned primary texts and course materials to adopt a critical and interpretative approach to the topics covered: to understand them both in their own time and terms, as well as for their contemporary resonances.

By the 16th century, when Europeans reached East Asia, China's Ming Dynasty and Japan's Muromachi Shogunate ruled over two of the most populous, urbanized, and sophisticated societies in the world with China the superior regional power. In the late 19th century, that longstanding status quo was abruptly upended. European and American steamships dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had begun its modernization and march to empire. Using short primary sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents) and field trips, we will study the dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies, highlighting connections and contrasts, as well as the impact that each has had on the other. How did Sino-Japanese relations in the early modern era lay the foundations for the current fraught relationship between these two East Asian powers? Confucianism, and the Chinese model of statecraft, which can be seen in the temples and other historical sites of Kyoto, as well as in the layout of the city (modeled on the Tang capital of Chang'an).  By the 16th century, when European merchants and missionaries first reached East Asia, the Ming Empire and the Muromachi Shogunate comprised two of the most  populous, urbanized, economically advanced, and culturally sophisticated societies in the world-with China clearly the  superior regional power.  By the early twentieth century, that status quo had been turned on its head.  European and  American steamships now dominated the Pacific, China was in the throes of social and political upheaval, and Japan had  begun its modernization and march to empire. Japan's defeat of China in 1895 marked its debut as a major power; soon  Japan would seize Korea and begin encroaching on China's Manchurian territories. Using textual sources (fiction, memoirs, and historical documents in English translation), as well as field trips to historical sites and museums, we will study the historical dynamics of Japanese and Chinese societies during these  centuries, highlighting their connections and contrasts, as well as the profound impact that each has had on the other.

The topic of this seminar is to understand the synchronicity of both contemporary and ancient architecture in the XXIst century, and the importance of beingimmersed in this human-made heritage.

We will also make references to similar gender topics in Western and other Asian societies.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":6,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":15368,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"6"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"}],"class_id":30188,"component":"LEC","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"6"}],"subject":"OSPKYOCT","tags":[],"title":"Gender in Japanese Culture","units_max":6,"units_min":6,"year":"2023-2024"},"384":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGKYOT","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"142","course_id":222139,"description":"Japan in East Asia","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":6,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28126,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"6"}],"subject":"OSPKYOCT","tags":[{"name":"ihc","organization":"IR"},{"name":"intlsec","organization":"IR"}],"title":"Japan in East Asia","units_max":6,"units_min":6,"year":"2023-2024"},"385":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGKYOT","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"156","course_id":207026,"description":"Kyoto's seminal role between 1850 and 1868 in triggering the Restoration, and the Restoration's seminal role in reinventing Kyoto as both a modern city and the cradle of Japan's traditional culture.

Quite simply, Darwin and Wallace needed the access to the tropics that opened up with the Age of Discovery in order to recognize the mechanisms of evolution. Class sessions will alternate between discussions and lectures. However, rather than modern primary literature or textbooks, the readings will come from three classic texts: Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle (1839), Henry Walter Bates' The Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863), and Alfred Russel Wallace's Malay Archipelago (1869). These three books cover much of the geography of the Iberian colonies founded in the Age of Discovery: respectively, Spanish South America and the Portuguese Amazon and Southeast Asia. No matter what &quot;mid-19th century popular science\/travelogue&quot; might suggest, these books are highly readable and show how insights sprang from individuals who confronted a newly available world with rigorous curiosity. (And they also highlight how much the tropics have changed and how oblivious people can be to the consequences of their actions.) The lectures will then bring up to date the science that developed from the explorations described in the texts. And Spain is the perfect location for a local focus to demonstrate the enormity of the geologic forces involved in what can otherwise feel like biogeographic abstractions. Imagine contact of North Africa and Iberia sealing off the Mediterranean, allowing it to dry down to brine in a hole more than 3 km deep and imagine Gibraltar being carved by its catastrophic reflooding, it all happened more than once and can be expected surely to happen again.","final_exam":true,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPMADRD","tags":[],"title":"New Worlds and Old: The biogeography of the Age of Discovery as the foundation for later insights in","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"430":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGMADR","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"102M","course_id":208113,"description":"Advanced.

This suggests that philosophy is not a collection of theories, but an emotional attitude toward a certain way of being. A philosopher is a person who is emotionally committed to becoming wise. The maxim Know Thyself! is regarded a main guiding principle in the philosopher's search for wisdom. It points us back towards ourselves, and presents our own personality as a subject to be studied and examined critically. Many have argued that this is not optional for those who wish to live well: as Socrates put it, the unexamined life is not worth living! Over the next ten weeks, we'll ask what it means to lead an examined life. We'll start by considering the opposite attitude, of the unthinking person who no longer cares to know truth from falsehood. We'll then ask how knowing oneself may differ from knowing others. Is there anything only you can know about yourself? Are there special, introspective means of coming to know yourself? If so, are they immune to error, or can you be mistaken about yourself? How can there be self-deception, where you're both the deceiver and the deceived? We cannot know ourselves fully without knowing our moral character, our virtues and vices, in addition to our thoughts and feelings and wishes. Knowing oneself is arguably a moral obligation, therefore, and thoughtlessness the hallmark of evil. Yet there is another pitfall to avoid, as self-reflection must not collapse into narcissistic self- preoccupation. This distinction will take us into the realm of the Unconscious, which by definition is not accessible to conscious reflection and thus limits how much we can know about ourselves. Despite our best efforts, it may be that we will ultimately remain a mystery to ourselves.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34685,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":13,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephanie","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Solywoda","middle_name":"","name":"Solywoda, S.","sunet_id":"solywoda"},{"first_name":"Sebastian","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Petzolt","middle_name":"","name":"Petzolt, S.","sunet_id":"petzolt"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 8, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[],"title":"Know Thyself !

Like their eighteenth-century gothic predecessors, many of these texts lacked literary respectability, though they achieved best seller status. Far beyond simply providing a jaded reading public with scandalous and suspenseful narratives loaded with sex, crime, mystery and even the supernatural, these texts attempted to expose not only the secrets of their protagonists, but also the seamy underbelly of outwardly respectable Victorian society, epitomized by the family with its angel of the house. Topics for discussion will include the literary and moral value of these sub-genres of the novel and what they reveal about Victorian society's anxiety over transgressive - and therefore prohibited - elements in the domestic and public sphere.","final_exam":true,"gers":["GER:DB-Hum","WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"demonstrate facility with the analysis of arguments for and against different theories and interpretations."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"understand diverse artistic, literary, and theoretical traditions, their characteristic forms of production, and\/or their development across historical time."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"acquire and assess techniques of interpretation (including close reading techniques), criticism, and analysis of cultural texts, artifacts, and practices."},{"code":"WAY-AII","description":"Understanding the effect of politics, science, religion and gender on the acts of writing and reading in the 18th and 19th centuries and today.\n\nPlacing the readings within their historical, cultural and literary context."}],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":31785,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":6,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"For students participating in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Oxford only.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Emma","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Plaskitt","middle_name":"","name":"Plaskitt, E.","sunet_id":"eplaskit"},{"first_name":"Stephanie","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Solywoda","middle_name":"","name":"Solywoda, S.","sunet_id":"solywoda"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"europe","organization":"IR"},{"name":"english","organization":"OSP"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Novels of Sensation: Gothic, Detective Story, Prohibition, and Transgression in Victorian Fiction","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"443":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"20","course_id":225372,"description":"Did Globalization Fail Britain?This course investigates the causes and effects of the British backlash to globalization.

The course will introduce students to the fundamental skills and methodological framework required for working with an informed humanities expertise; a professional expertise that is critical, recognizing complexity, different viewpoints, and open-ended interpretation. Students will learn to read and interpret archival sources, and to practice the description, analysis, and public-facing discussion of primary materials.

We will apply range of scholarly approaches to these works and their lives on film and in the theatre, including close reading, performance studies, critical race studies, queer studies, and gender studies. Students will be introduced to these methodological frameworks early in the course, and are free to apply any of them in their assignments. Throughout our exploration of these canonical works, we will consider how today's theatre and film makers, as well as their audiences, engage with these plays to make new meanings and interventions in contemporary culture. Central to our discussion will be an interrogation of the place of Shakespeare in contemporary British culture, chiefly through analysis of performances of his plays and those of his contemporaries in major national institutions: Shakespeare's Globe, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC, and the mainstream film industry. At the same time, however, we will be equally concerned with how marginalised groups, including minority ethnic and queer artists, have turned to Shakespeare's plays in order to reposition his works, and themselves, on the global and political stage. These in-class discussions, supported by study-group preparation, will prepare students for the written assignments, which are designed to allow students to interpret these plays and their theatrical\/filmic afterlives, with a particular focus on the social and political implications of staging and screening these plays in today's diverse British society. Each week, students will be expected to have read the set text (a play by either Shakespeare or his contemporaries) and, in one of three 'study groups,' to have engaged with a critical or interpretative response to that text based on assigned reading or viewing (usually a scholarly reading, or a film or theatrical adaptation).","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"class_id":22555,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":0,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Summer","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"taps","organization":"OSP"}],"title":"Shakespeare and Performance","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"461":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Summer","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SUM"}],"code":"61","course_id":223281,"description":"What is it like to start your own company?

Questions of ethics underlie every aspect of AI, beginning with the question of whether it is even coherent to speak of an intelligence other than humans. This course presents current ethical issues in the development and application of artificial intelligence through a series of recent case studies. We will spend the first part of the course studying major ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) and closely-linked research areas within AI and machine learning. In the second part of the course, we will apply these principles to case studies from major areas of debate in AI, with a focus on the translation of ethical principles into practical decisions.The first examples from AI we will cover are existential risks in the context of utilitarianism, the &quot;hidden&quot; labour force of AI in the context of deontology, and the problem of replacing humans in the context of virtue ethics. For the case studies, we will first study fairness and bias in the training and deployment of machine learning models. We will ask what it means for an AI system to be &quot;fair&quot;, and how to regulate models which are not interpretable. This is followed by the problems of copyright and large scale training datasets for generative AI models, where we will ask what constitutes unfair use of existing material when it is only being used to train. We continue in a more hypothetical lens with a discussion of whether or not an AI system could be a moral agent or patient, and what rights a non-human intelligence might have. Finally, we conclude with the alignment problem, where we focus on the practical challenges of value alignment and the plausibility of finding a set of values which could be universally accepted.

The history side of the course would consider how the Thames has played a role in the history of Britain, e.g., as an inland transportation corridor, as a barrier between states, as the site of the signing of the Magna Carta, as the heart of the global trade enterprise that built the British Empire, as a challenge to important engineering feats in Victorian London, as a subject for landscape painters like Turner, and as a spur of public policies of environmental protection and restoration.","final_exam":true,"gers":["WAY-AQR"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":5,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":28146,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":15,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":999,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Stephen","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Monismith","middle_name":"G","name":"Monismith, S.","sunet_id":"stephen"},{"first_name":"Stephanie","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Solywoda","middle_name":"","name":"Solywoda, S.","sunet_id":"solywoda"},{"first_name":"Pirta","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Palola","middle_name":"","name":"Palola, P.","sunet_id":"pirta"}],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"4-5"}],"subject":"OSPOXFRD","tags":[{"name":"enviro","organization":"EARTHSYS"}],"title":"From the hills to the sea","units_max":5,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"474":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGOXFO","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"93","course_id":214958,"description":"The art, science, and culture of the creation, transmission and collection of valuable, useful and informative objects and texts before the twentieth century, and the associated theories, purposes, and methods for collecting `worldly' goods and other valuables.

The ways that these &quot;cultural migrants&quot; have represented their journey and negotiated their multi-layered identities in their work, both then and now, will be explored.  Current day migration in a post-colonial context will also be studied, as a means to discover the various strategies used by contemporary artists to humanize and give visibility to the struggle of the displaced, while addressing societal concerns fueling displacement today, including racial, social, religious and gender inequality, conflict, and climate change.Instructional format will include in-class lectures, discussions with contemporary artists, and above all, site visits to Parisian museums, neighborhoods and relevant socio-cultural institutions.

We will examine foundational works while considering their engagement with the historical and political contexts in which they were produced, conveying the changing aspects of Parisian social landscape in the broader Francophone cultures of Paris (e.g. examining the dialogue with Francophone artists from Sub-Saharan Africa).

We will analyse recent initiatives in the realm of commemorative events of the colonial past and its legacy, specifically of diverse controversies facing contemporary French and North African societies today.

Long considered an international artistic capital, Paris is seen today as one of the most dynamic centers of contemporary street art, since its emergence in the 1960s.  The course will address the multiple forms, techniques and labels used in relation to urban or street art, while exploring prevalent themes broached, including racial and gender inequality, anti-capitalism and climate activism.  The motivations, goals, and inspirations of both renowned and emerging practitioners in Paris and beyond will be studied to place street art in a wider art historical and activist context.  Throughout the course, the paradoxical notions surrounding contemporary street art will be considered: revolt versus appropriation, urban degradation versus beautification and even speculation, delinquency versus activism, anonymity versus stardom, street versus screen. Forms of instruction will include in-class discussions and debates, student presentations, guest lectures by street artists and other cultural actors, site visits to community and cultural institutions and city walks to explore the writing on the walls in diverse Parisian neighborhoods.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":3,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[],"title":"The Writing on the Walls: Street Art in Paris, yesterday and today","units_max":3,"units_min":3,"year":"2023-2024"},"566":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Winter","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"WIN"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"50M","course_id":212687,"description":"Topics include: the relationship between atomic structure and macroscopic properties of man-made and natural materials; mechanical and thermodynamic behavior of surgical implants including alloys, ceramics, and polymers; and materials selection for biotechnology applications such as contact lenses, artificial joints, and cardiovascular stents.

This unique situation will allow students to learn about the origins of cinema and the importance of film to French culture during class field trips. The professor will provide technical guidance about news reporting and film production in general and how to make a short documentary. As a final project each student will create a personal 2-3 minute short film using their smart phone about a theme relating to their time in Paris.

Eighteenth-century writers, scientists, and aristocrats sought to burnish Paris's reputation as the capital of modern thought and worldly sophistication, from which Enlightenment radiated. Visitors eagerly sought admittance to the famous salons, attended the theater, and watched public scientific displays. But by the end of the century, the novelty promised by the French philosophes took on a revolutionary dimension. Now the streets of Paris provided the stage for some of the most momentous historical events in Europe, from the storming of the Bastille to the execution of Louis XVI. And the ramifications of this revolution echoed throughout the nineteenth century, both in Paris and beyond.In this course, you will study the cultural and political history of Paris using the city itself as a classroom. Whenever possible, you will explore the role of salons, scientific academies, museums, and coffee shops by both studying and visiting them in person.

Navigating critical challenges faced by our human condition such as making sense of the world around us, self-expression and representation, migration and mobility, identity negotiations and sense of multi-belonging, the contemporary French artists (writers, filmmakers, architects, rappers) have found themselves at the center of French and Francophone cultural life for quite a while. This course will explore luvres from Leila Slimani's Chanson douce to Rachid Bouchareb's Indig&egrave;nes, taking side trips into the topsy-turvy world of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, the ingeniosity of Alain Mabanckou's Verre cass&eacute;, the poetic spleen of Stromae's Racine carr&eacute;e, the unapologetic French vision of Fatou Diome's Marianne porte plainte!, the fierce narrative of Kim Lef&egrave;vre's M&eacute;tisse blanche, and the inventive questioning of urban life in Djamel Klouche's architecture. We will consider the play of words, the strategies behind first-person narrative and compare it with the alternate third person and the &quot;we&quot; one in different art mediums. Why are so many authors and protagonists still obsessed with the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), 60 years after the end of the war? How does the move from an early almost exclusively male-dominated cultural scene to a more gender balanced one translate into their artistic productions ?","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"OSPPARIS","tags":[],"title":"Migration Matters in Cinema and Literature: Francophone Authors Inside Out","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"594":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGPARI","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"99","course_id":224798,"description":"Short stories have been an important literary and cultural tradition in France since 1690. Classical authors, folktale writers, translators of &quot;oriental&quot; fictions, aristocrats, and femmes du monde have produced a large corpus of short stories. These stories are far from being mere fairy tales; they unveil the violence of the Early Modern period while revealing the horrors of social and domestic violence. This course has two goals: the first one is to present the nature, extent and causes of domestic, social, and everyday violence in absolute regimes of the early modern times. The second one is to &quot;read&quot; violence and the emotions linked to it in popular tale narratives. Our repertoire will include popular French tales, such as Les Contes de Perrault, and the philosophical and political tales of Rousseau, Diderot, and Voltaire. Our approach will be comparative, psychoanalytic, feminist, cross-cultural, sociological, and anthropological. Format: seminar. Taught in French.

Secondly, cadets will hone their writing and briefing skills.  Many of the cadets will be uncomfortable with public speaking, and this semester is designed to get them used to briefing.  The second semester is centered on leadership and ethics, and is mostly guided discussion.  The goal here is to get cadets thinking about leadership through their own lens, and give them some tools to work on their leadership skills.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Satisfactory\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":2,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":true,"sections":[{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":15015,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":2,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"Instructor: Carnovale; Course held at San Jose State University (SJSU) campus; SJSU is on the semester system; SJSU Course - AS 131A.","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Dec 8, 2023","end_time":"","instructors":[],"location":"","start_date":"Sep 26, 2023","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Autumn","units":"2"},{"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Spring","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"SPR"},{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"class_id":15233,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":2,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":30,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Jun 5, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Marshal","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Neubauer","middle_name":"Cole","name":"Neubauer, M.","sunet_id":"marshaln"}],"location":"","start_date":"Apr 1, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Spring","units":"2"}],"subject":"ROTCAF","tags":[{"name":"alluniversityabove100","organization":"EDUC"},{"name":"alluniversity","organization":"EDUC"}],"title":"Leading People and Effective Communication","units_max":2,"units_min":2,"year":"2023-2024"},"650":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"VPUE","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"141","course_id":213965,"description":"A cadet should comprehend the basic elements of national security policy and process.

We saw this during the COVID-19 pandemic, when an urgent need arose to disseminate science-based health messages to the public. Because levels of education and literacy vary, didactic and overly technical media messages often miss the audiences that need them the most. Adolescents and young adults are often among the hardest to reach with effective public health messages. At the same time, these audiences are the highest consumers of short video content via social media, presenting an interesting opportunity for public health educators.This course examines various approaches to increasing the reach and effectiveness of digital communication media for global dissemination. We will examine existing evidence-based frameworks including human-centered design, the use of narratives, entertainment-education and how we can apply the principles of universal design for learning to our efforts to engage a broad, global audience.We will also explore novel use cases for animated video interventions in global settings and innovative research methods for evaluating the effectiveness of digital health content, using large, online randomized controlled experiments. This innovative approach to measuring impact emerged out of necessity during the pandemic but is likely here to stay.Students will be exposed to the theory, science and creative process needed to create and test engaging digital communication media. In small groups, students will apply this knowledge to the creation of their own public-facing media message on a topic of interest, integrating new technical skills with art and communication.","final_exam":false,"gers":[""],"grading_basis":"Letter or Credit\/No Credit","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[{"attributes":[],"class_id":34874,"component":"SEM","curr_class_size":3,"curr_waitlist_size":0,"max_class_size":18,"max_waitlist_size":0,"notes":"","schedules":[{"days":[],"end_date":"Mar 15, 2024","end_time":"","instructors":[{"first_name":"Maya","is_primary_instructor":true,"last_name":"Adam","middle_name":"","name":"Adam, M.","sunet_id":"madam"},{"first_name":"Rosina","is_primary_instructor":false,"last_name":"Miller","middle_name":"S","name":"Miller, R.","sunet_id":"romiller"}],"location":"","start_date":"Jan 8, 2024","start_time":""}],"section_num":"01","term":"2023-2024 Winter","units":"4"}],"subject":"SINY","tags":[],"title":"Design for Extreme Scalability: An Introduction to Global Communication and Media Innovation","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"692":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"SUPROGNYC","active":true,"attributes":[{"catalog_print":true,"description":"Autumn","name":"NQTR","schedule_print":false,"value":"AUT"}],"code":"121","course_id":222453,"description":"In this immersive intensive, students will learn the basics from professionals in the fields of Acting, Directing, Theatrical Management, Union Representation and Stage Management.

The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class.

Classical music means different things to different people. For some it connotes Western art music of a particular historical era. According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free.

Social media have greatly enlivened and democratized science communication so that it now moves between scientists and various audiences. Scientific content is no longer static, nor is it merely for advanced researchers. Scientists using social media are learning to assess content collaboratively to help provide better science in public communication. One of the particular obligations of university science students is to join the conversation, help review and revise content in the public sphere.

This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy?

In this course, we will explore the variety of formats that science communication can take--from technical research papers on particle physics to children's books about genetics. We will explore how different audiences shape the way science is communicated, and we will develop a set of best practices for effective science communication.

After all, European modernism began with the encounter of the New World, and Europe&iquest;s own identity was forged in the process of &iquest;Latinization&iquest; of the Western Hemisphere. In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent. This course introduces students to primary decolonial rhetorical texts and asks students to apply these insights to pressing contemporary challenges by practicing deep reading of primary and secondary texts, preparing group presentations, and exploring creative acts of composition with an eye toward imagining brave new worlds and the decolonial rhetorical practices valued therein.","final_exam":false,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-EDP"],"grading_basis":"Letter (ABCD\/NP)","max_times_repeat":1,"max_units_repeat":4,"objectives":[],"offer_num":"1","repeatable":false,"sections":[],"subject":"PWR","tags":[],"title":"Brave New Worlds: An Introduction to (De)colonial Rhetorics","units_max":4,"units_min":4,"year":"2023-2024"},"1030":{"academic_career":"UG","academic_group":"VPUE","academic_org":"PWR","active":true,"attributes":[],"code":"194DH","course_id":217417,"description":"Does not fulfill NSC requirement.

But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
